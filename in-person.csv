P32,00:00:08,T7,First,Offline, Do we need to read though all the pile?
P31,00:00:10,T7,First,Offline, Yeah. I would
P29,00:00:13,T7,First,Offline,Do you wanna collect these from around and then pass it on
P31,00:00:15,T7,First,Offline, and you can also sort
P32,00:00:17,T7,First,Offline, or should I just maybe tell it to Lore what it is about
P29,00:00:20,T7,First,Offline, Yeah. that should be quicker
P31,00:00:21,T7,First,Offline, But me  maybe all can go over the pile and then everyone can see it
P32,00:00:24,T7,First,Offline, Yeah
P29,00:00:28,T7,First,Offline, Yeah. But we all want to read them and basically tell this and that
P31,00:00:29,T7,First,Offline, I feel like completely like don't have.  I don't have the advantage to deploy any of these
P29,00:02:00,T7,First,Offline, Well. Are you done if you don't mind? 
P31,00:03:06,T7,First,Offline, I have done like three or four
P29,00:03:18,T7,First,Offline, I have done all of them so just let me know when you guys are ready
P31,00:03:34,T7,First,Offline, Anyone left?
P30,00:03:52,T7,First,Offline, So basically you just read them and?
P29,00:04:05,T7,First,Offline, Yeah.  I just read these definitions
P32,00:04:09,T7,First,Offline, I still have three more
P31,00:04:34,T7,First,Offline, Should we just start talking about the projects?
P32,00:04:39,T7,First,Offline, Yeah. I don't mind
P29,00:04:41,T7,First,Offline, So I have got all the apps here. The first one seems pretty straightforward; this one he give me evidence and nutrition support app. So the main paragraph is here. In this project we propose the development of a prototype mobile app to provide	 concise	 research led	 nutritional information to educate families and the general public in an engaging but simple and easy to understand manner. Through the involvement of blah blah blah doh doh doh. the app will not only provide correct nutritional information	 but will encourage healthy eating habits taking the user though the basic information in a fun and interactive way using simple pictures/graphs and diagrams	 diagrams	 will offer snack substitutions	 use persuasive language with a personal coach guided approach with the option of scheduled alerts with positive affirmations doh doh doh. The use of this mobile phone app will cut through any uncertainty and doubt over correct information	 eliminate the confusion surrounding what to eat	 when and how. So it's basically a very straightforward info app on nutrition.
P31,00:04:56,T7,First,Offline, It's basically seems like an HCI rather a code project 
P29,00:04:58,T7,First,Offline, Well. I mean this like this project seems so far pretty straightforward
P32,00:05:01,T7,First,Offline, That seems quite a nice one and quite one to break down into different sections 
P29,00:05:05,T7,First,Offline, Yeah. I can only see the kind of things that we will be doing for only reading the description. 
P31,00:05:07,T7,First,Offline, I though we will be doing a lot of graphic designing 
P29,00:05:12,T7,First,Offline, I don't know
P31,00:05:15,T7,First,Offline, Yeah
P29,00:05:18,T7,First,Offline, It's going to be an app
P31,00:05:20,T7,First,Offline, Yeah. I know do designing
P29,00:05:24,T7,First,Offline, Have you done JavaFX?
P31,00:05:28,T7,First,Offline, No
P29,00:05:41,T7,First,Offline, It's not exactly Java. It's like kind of splits off java script
P31,00:06:02,T7,First,Offline, It's like we choosing right now
P32,00:06:26,T7,First,Offline, No no
P29,00:07:14,T7,First,Offline, The next one
P32,00:07:21,T7,First,Offline, Okay
P29,00:07:22,T7,First,Offline, Scriptate
P31,00:07:57,T7,First,Offline, Scriptate
P29,00:08:11,T7,First,Offline, Scriptate like annotate Scriptate. I read the list here
P31,00:08:13,T7,First,Offline, So
P29,00:08:15,T7,First,Offline, I don't know. I think it's like an interactive media player 
P31,00:08:25,T7,First,Offline, It's more of massive app
P29,00:08:30,T7,First,Offline, Yeah that will be bigger app
P32,00:08:37,T7,First,Offline, I think one of the good reason of doing this app is that it's easy to scale also
P29,00:08:53,T7,First,Offline, Yeah with the ending point
P32,00:08:57,T7,First,Offline, So for this one I think if we chose that one over others it will be easier to scale
P29,00:09:42,T7,First,Offline,  Yeah I know. Okay
P32,00:09:47,T7,First,Offline, Are going to this one?
P29,00:10:49,T7,First,Offline, Let me read the last bit. Ideally we want this device to be a cross platform smartphone app capable of being used by either our technicians or groundsmen to conduct this assessment and illustrate the performance in this test. We would also like to be able to direct generate reports of the surface's performance as well as share results when required.
P32,00:10:51,T7,First,Offline, I don't like this one
P31,00:10:58,T7,First,Offline, Honestly
P29,00:11:36,T7,First,Offline, That's not for a market
P31,00:11:46,T7,First,Offline, Yeah
P29,00:11:50,T7,First,Offline, So that's another thing. It's going to be less like having to work with fancy designs or whatever
P32,00:11:53,T7,First,Offline, Yeah I know that  
P31,00:11:57,T7,First,Offline, What do you think?
P29,00:12:00,T7,First,Offline, I don't know. First of all
P31,00:12:02,T7,First,Offline, You're goanna be happy about doing this one
P32,00:12:04,T7,First,Offline, We hold on to that one like at least go over other things and see if we want to with it or something else 
P31,00:12:07,T7,First,Offline, It's just because we can take your point of view for this team project also do something else than something we used to
P31,00:12:08,T7,First,Offline,  Like a web app
P29,00:12:11,T7,First,Offline, We have these two very quick
P31,00:12:13,T7,First,Offline, sorry
P29,00:12:15,T7,First,Offline,  Here is a web app
P30,00:12:17,T7,First,Offline, Something like Modules or something?
P29,00:12:19,T7,First,Offline, Yeah it seem like kind of classroom comment session 
P32,00:12:23,T7,First,Offline, I don't mind this app. I don't mind if you guys want to but I'm not sure about this
P31,00:12:25,T7,First,Offline, They literally wrote this on the notepad Apple and windows
P29,00:12:27,T7,First,Offline, Yeah
P31,00:12:28,T7,First,Offline, Okay
P29,00:12:30,T7,First,Offline,I don't know what this even like. Like it tells you when the entity is pressed I don't even fucking know. It's like something from the 90s and 80s.
P31,00:12:32,T7,First,Offline, This is basically like yalkrs
P32,00:12:35,T7,First,Offline, Yeah
P29,00:12:37,T7,First,Offline, Yeah
P32,00:12:38,T7,First,Offline, I thought you guys want to do the apps
P30,00:12:40,T7,First,Offline, Did you see this?
P29,00:12:44,T7,First,Offline, No
P30,00:12:46,T7,First,Offline, Pictures
P29,00:12:47,T7,First,Offline, Yeah. They only mention in class polls and quizzes and like comments sections between lecturers and students
P32,00:12:49,T7,First,Offline, I think if we know how badly yalkrs has been built all years
P29,00:12:51,T7,First,Offline, Did you see the YouTube video?
P31,00:12:54,T7,First,Offline, Yeah 
P29,00:12:57,T7,First,Offline,  This is one which is the guy who makes yalkrs he put it up and explained how to use it and the student during comment section ask him can you please make this and that?  The guy says that not very helpful
P31,00:12:59,T7,First,Offline, Yeah 
P32,00:13:02,T7,First,Offline, This year…
P29,00:13:04,T7,First,Offline, I think the main comment is that it's so bad. Anyway
P30,00:13:05,T7,First,Offline, I understand 
P32,00:13:07,T7,First,Offline, They are not awful at all but can't be most helpful
P29,00:13:10,T7,First,Offline, I feel like the research projects their clients would be more likely than would…
P32,00:13:12,T7,First,Offline,  You brought the interesting things
P29,00:13:13,T7,First,Offline, Yeah I don't know 
P31,00:13:15,T7,First,Offline, Well my dad could have helped us
P32,00:13:16,T7,First,Offline, Do you know what I mean?
P29,00:13:19,T7,First,Offline, Yeah
P32,00:13:22,T7,First,Offline, If you guys like this
P29,00:13:25,T7,First,Offline, It's pretty med tech
P31,00:13:27,T7,First,Offline, I was goanna write this 
P32,00:13:29,T7,First,Offline, it that's their first impression
P30,00:13:33,T7,First,Offline, Anybody is interested in biology?
P32,00:13:36,T7,First,Offline, Yeah
P29,00:13:38,T7,First,Offline, No
P31,00:13:41,T7,First,Offline, I have picked two by the way
P29,00:13:44,T7,First,Offline, ok. Good good good …
P32,00:13:47,T7,First,Offline, Ok who wants to go next? 
P30,00:13:49,T7,First,Offline, Me.  I have this application here
P32,00:13:53,T7,First,Offline, What's called?
P30,00:13:54,T7,First,Offline,  It's called Actify
P31,00:13:59,T7,First,Offline, Actify?
P30,00:14:02,T7,First,Offline, Yes. So
P31,00:14:04,T7,First,Offline, What?
P29,00:14:07,T7,First,Offline, in the education stuff here.
P29,00:14:11,T7,First,Offline, I'm totally lost
P31,00:14:14,T7,First,Offline, Can I see it?
P30,00:14:16,T7,First,Offline, Yeah
P30,00:14:21,T7,First,Offline, Basically
P31,00:14:25,T7,First,Offline, Save money
P30,00:14:27,T7,First,Offline, Save money
P29,00:14:30,T7,First,Offline, Save money okay
P30,00:14:31,T7,First,Offline, This is the main objective
P31,00:14:34,T7,First,Offline, Learning physical activity. Wait  
P30,00:14:37,T7,First,Offline, So basically..
P31,00:14:41,T7,First,Offline, People who experience physical activity. We would like to produce an application which helps to gather data concerning individuals' experiences of being physically active and the factors which have impacted them throughout their lives. This data could be used to influence: the future planning and delivery of physical activity programmes and services; how staff in the physical activity sector are trained and developed throughout their careers; and how physical activity providers and policy makers interact with the public to increase levels of physical activity
P29,00:14:45,T7,First,Offline, They expect people like just to use the app
P31,00:14:48,T7,First,Offline, I think it's a massive physical activity app
P29,00:14:51,T7,First,Offline, Sounds pretty vague 
P31,00:14:53,T7,First,Offline, Yeah. So basically just gathering data and having an app
P30,00:14:56,T7,First,Offline, I actually like this one
P29,00:14:58,T7,First,Offline, Why would go with that one?
P30,00:15:00,T7,First,Offline, Because of the data
P31,00:15:03,T7,First,Offline, You mean data visualisation or just gathering data
P30,00:15:08,T7,First,Offline, I think data like something more interesting for me
P31,00:15:11,T7,First,Offline, I like the data visualisation
P29,00:15:13,T7,First,Offline, My understanding it seems like an app nobody is goanna use
P31,00:15:17,T7,First,Offline, Yeah
P30,00:15:18,T7,First,Offline, As long like they like you make people try their selves
P29,00:15:21,T7,First,Offline, Well first
P32,00:15:23,T7,First,Offline, The next one
P30,00:15:25,T7,First,Offline, The next one.  So this one
P32,00:15:28,T7,First,Offline, What's called?
P30,00:15:33,T7,First,Offline, Part of this work
P31,00:15:35,T7,First,Offline, What?
P33,00:15:36,T7,First,Offline, Oh
P30,00:15:39,T7,First,Offline, Sorry?
P33,00:15:45,T7,First,Offline, It's CERN. The centre of European Organization for Nuclear Research
P30,00:15:48,T7,First,Offline, Yeah
P33,00:15:51,T7,First,Offline, Did you hear the news about?
P30,00:15:58,T7,First,Offline, This is a part of the thing that they are trying to upgrade the inner sensors
P31,00:16:00,T7,First,Offline, Yeah. They want something really for production and sensors for inner tracker upgrade involves sensitive electronic will require monitoring and control of the production/testing environment for conditions such as temperature and humidity. 
P29,00:16:02,T7,First,Offline, So we would have do it in Linux?
P31,00:16:04,T7,First,Offline,Yeah it involves a network of environmental sensors (for example DHT22 devices connected to arduino/raspberry pi devices. This would be like systems and
P30,00:16:06,T7,First,Offline, Electronics 
P31,00:16:09,T7,First,Offline, Electronics
P29,00:16:11,T7,First,Offline, I'm not crazy about sensors 
P32,00:16:13,T7,First,Offline, I like this app for learning
P31,00:16:15,T7,First,Offline, The data from several sensors communicating to one over several servers will require a common structure to identify and return information. Analysis algorithms
P29,00:16:19,T7,First,Offline, I would like to not take this project which I have to learn a lot from it
P31,00:16:22,T7,First,Offline, You can learn a bit but not most of it
P29,00:16:24,T7,First,Offline, Yeah. You can predict how long you goanna need to learn all this
P30,00:16:25,T7,First,Offline, Yeah exactly 
P29,00:16:28,T7,First,Offline, You know
P31,00:16:30,T7,First,Offline, If you want to do the other one
P30,00:16:32,T7,First,Offline, Bad stuff
P32,00:16:34,T7,First,Offline, Yeah. Okay
P31,00:16:36,T7,First,Offline, Is this the nature app?
P32,00:16:37,T7,First,Offline, Yes
P31,00:16:40,T7,First,Offline, What's the real time?
P32,00:16:42,T7,First,Offline, The mapping of Sparrows and also they want to make an update of their older apps and link them with the third app. I think it sounds …
P29,00:16:47,T7,First,Offline, So they want us both to work on old apps and create this new one?
P32,00:16:51,T7,First,Offline, Yes. I think it sounds like interesting
P29,00:16:53,T7,First,Offline, Oh yeah
P32,00:16:56,T7,First,Offline, like a way of understanding things at least if it's clean slate at least it's clean slate
P29,00:16:58,T7,First,Offline, I had to do a lot but it takes so long time to understand someone's code for me
P32,00:17:00,T7,First,Offline, Yeah a team of five last year build it. So yup
P30,00:17:04,T7,First,Offline, I think as Tim says
P32,00:17:06,T7,First,Offline, Okay
P29,00:17:10,T7,First,Offline, Craneware?
P32,00:17:13,T7,First,Offline, Craneware
P29,00:17:14,T7,First,Offline, I don't know about ML
P32,00:17:18,T7,First,Offline, No
P29,00:17:21,T7,First,Offline, angular is this a Java script
P32,00:17:24,T7,First,Offline, No
P29,00:17:26,T7,First,Offline, I don't like Java script
P32,00:17:28,T7,First,Offline, First of all it's seems this is the least comfort from me
P29,00:17:30,T7,First,Offline, I don't I'm not so sure about this
P31,00:17:32,T7,First,Offline, A mission to present data in digestible and useful 
P32,00:17:34,T7,First,Offline, And they want this to be more dynamic like if 
P31,00:17:35,T7,First,Offline, It's not really sure what they like what data they want. Like they said they want the data to be presented in digestible way
P32,00:17:40,T7,First,Offline, It's like forgetting anything
P31,00:17:41,T7,First,Offline, We don't know what
P32,00:17:44,T7,First,Offline, It's like way yeah
P29,00:17:49,T7,First,Offline, What does this even mean?
P30,00:17:51,T7,First,Offline, I'm totally lost
P32,00:17:54,T7,First,Offline, It's not always like the same
P31,00:17:57,T7,First,Offline, Yeah this is a bit vague
P32,00:17:59,T7,First,Offline, I have this one
P31,00:18:00,T7,First,Offline, self-management
P32,00:18:01,T7,First,Offline, Yeah I think it; also needs to be connected to GPs and it's need to be an iOs and android because they want to keep tracking diary 
P31,00:18:03,T7,First,Offline, This is basically the fitness app
P32,00:18:05,T7,First,Offline, Yeah
P29,00:18:08,T7,First,Offline, It sounds more interesting
P31,00:18:11,T7,First,Offline, Pain diarrhea
P29,00:18:15,T7,First,Offline, Wait I thought it's a chronic pain app?
P31,00:18:19,T7,First,Offline,No they said they want a pain diary
P29,00:18:21,T7,First,Offline, It's a diary
P31,00:18:24,T7,First,Offline, di diar diary
P29,00:18:27,T7,First,Offline, I thought you said diarrhea so I thought that's something different
P32,00:18:28,T7,First,Offline, You had that one but simply missing
P29,00:18:30,T7,First,Offline, Yup I think that one. Plus it's bioinformatics which is data mining
P30,00:18:32,T7,First,Offline, As long as we don't have
P32,00:18:34,T7,First,Offline, And it has partnership with NHS Dumfries and Galloway
P29,00:18:37,T7,First,Offline, Okay. Wait on Dumfries and Galloway?
P32,00:18:40,T7,First,Offline, Yes.
P29,00:18:44,T7,First,Offline, So if they are not going to be here like we goanna have to 
P30,00:18:49,T7,First,Offline,  Go to them?
P29,00:18:55,T7,First,Offline, No no no
P31,00:18:58,T7,First,Offline, Isn't that just encompass Glasgow area?
P32,00:19:05,T7,First,Offline, It's not in elsewhere
P29,00:19:08,T7,First,Offline, No you probably are right
P31,00:19:10,T7,First,Offline, They working in partnership with NHS
P32,00:19:11,T7,First,Offline, I think 
P31,00:19:15,T7,First,Offline, It's pain association Scotland that dose it 
P30,00:19:18,T7,First,Offline, Basically they are teaming up with the Scottish what?
P32,00:19:20,T7,First,Offline, NHS
P30,00:19:27,T7,First,Offline, Maybe someone is here actually
P31,00:19:29,T7,First,Offline, What?
P29,00:19:32,T7,First,Offline, What do you mean?
P30,00:19:36,T7,First,Offline, We don't need to go there
P31,00:19:38,T7,First,Offline, No 
P29,00:19:41,T7,First,Offline, The NHS like it's all connected. 
P32,00:19:42,T7,First,Offline, We just phone them
P29,00:19:45,T7,First,Offline, I think most people will be commutating with phone or something 
P31,00:19:46,T7,First,Offline, Yeah 
P30,00:19:49,T7,First,Offline, Face-face is very important
P31,00:19:50,T7,First,Offline,  No they would come here
P29,00:19:52,T7,First,Offline, So they an office in Edinburgh
P31,00:19:54,T7,First,Offline, Unless you paid for it you can't just ask us 
P29,00:19:56,T7,First,Offline, No	 I'm not goanna go anywhere
P31,00:19:58,T7,First,Offline, Oh yeah I know. Anyway	 so you done with your projects
P32,00:20:00,T7,First,Offline, Yes
P31,00:20:01,T7,First,Offline, I got a lot. So the first one I had was about…
P32,00:20:04,T7,First,Offline, What's the name?
P31,00:20:06,T7,First,Offline, It's neural network-based arcade game
P33,00:20:11,T7,First,Offline, Oh I don't like it
P31,00:20:12,T7,First,Offline, So it's about craft prospect	 they want you	 wait where was the thing? They have made two games and they want to combine the strengths of both games into a single arcade-style game which can be played online or in person. The games should use neural net-powered feature detection and a semi-accurate facsimile of satellite orbital behaviour.
P29,00:20:15,T7,First,Offline, Do we have to know about computer graphics as well?
P31,00:20:17,T7,First,Offline, Yeah.  It says: as a first step	 a suitable means of interfacing a suitable simulation framework	 such as Python	 with a compatible visualisation method	 such as VTK	 STK or Blender	 would be investigated
P29,00:20:21,T7,First,Offline, I don't know anything about computer graphics
P31,00:20:24,T7,First,Offline, I still don't know what game they want us to bulid
P29,00:20:27,T7,First,Offline, They want you to reuse the code for the other two tool kits
P30,00:20:31,T7,First,Offline, Make it one game?
P31,00:20:32,T7,First,Offline, I think we wouldn't know like what.. Okay this is smarter grid solutions they just want us basically to look at weather data get something out of it
P32,00:20:36,T7,First,Offline, I pass over that because I know it will be failed failed
P31,00:20:39,T7,First,Offline, They want to have standalone service that can predict the current non-curtailed output of a generator. But and they say the primary function of this service is to aggregate weather data from online and offline sources	 to store this weather data locally and then predict output power from this data and a set of known generator characteristics. So	 they want us to use a REST interface and anything else that works
P29,00:20:42,T7,First,Offline, Isn't like weather data is pretty advanced and complicated stuff?
P32,00:20:44,T7,First,Offline, I have no knowledge about that
P30,00:20:46,T7,First,Offline, Is in Python	 by the way?
P31,00:20:52,T7,First,Offline, Sorry
P30,00:20:54,T7,First,Offline, Is it Python?
P31,00:20:57,T7,First,Offline, You can use whatever you want first it's a standalone service
P29,00:21:01,T7,First,Offline, I feel like it's goanna be lots of data science and Python 
P31,00:21:04,T7,First,Offline, I would have said Python
P30,00:21:05,T7,First,Offline, I like working with data	 but I think 
P31,00:21:07,T7,First,Offline, I think it would be too simple just looking at the data and mining things
P32,00:21:09,T7,First,Offline, I don't like working with the weather
P29,00:21:11,T7,First,Offline, It has to do with information retrieval and 
P32,00:21:14,T7,First,Offline, Offline and online
P31,00:21:17,T7,First,Offline, Yeah where the data can be moved	 did you work with the..?
P29,00:21:20,T7,First,Offline, The Linux thing?
P31,00:21:22,T7,First,Offline, Yeah
P29,00:21:25,T7,First,Offline, That was not actual weather data just taking some data from a website 
P31,00:21:28,T7,First,Offline, I feel don't know what expect from us
P29,00:21:30,T7,First,Offline, Well that's a lot for me
P31,00:21:33,T7,First,Offline, Okay then we have Medipix. So they want the proposed group project will extend existing and bring new functionality to the MM software which is a plugin for an open source image analysis package Image IJ is written in Java while MM - in C++. So they want us to create capability to compile MM and Medipix hardware plugin on Linux	 Mac and Raspberry Pi. This is like very system
P32,00:21:35,T7,First,Offline, I'm not interested	 probably not
P31,00:21:38,T7,First,Offline, I'm not very interested. Development of new MM functionality for Medipix and external software integration capability
P29,00:21:41,T7,First,Offline, I'm okay with one. Like with all other coding with had so far
P32,00:21:45,T7,First,Offline, First	 they are extending	 I just don't like this. I feel that will take a lot of learning to get to the start of our project almost
P29,00:21:46,T7,First,Offline, Yeah. Ok
P32,00:21:50,T7,First,Offline, Don't mind if you like 
P29,00:21:52,T7,First,Offline, I would like to keep this one
P31,00:21:55,T7,First,Offline, That's fine
P32,00:21:58,T7,First,Offline, Yeah
P31,00:22:02,T7,First,Offline, Then this one is about youth charity. So basically they have a youth centre with a data centre of user activity and last year a team worked on digital turnstile for reception centre	 but this year they want downloadable mobile application which maximises young person engagement facilitates the organisation and attendance of in-centre activities and develops an integrated culture of return visits.
P29,00:22:04,T7,First,Offline, Dose this has to do with anything with return styles?
P31,00:22:08,T7,First,Offline, No it just says want to deal with further
P29,00:22:10,T7,First,Offline, OK
P31,00:22:12,T7,First,Offline, so they want user profiles	 interactive events / programmes calendar	 feedback form	 and desirably user mailbox and media feed. If technically feasible	 a journey planner
P29,00:22:17,T7,First,Offline,  I like it
P31,00:22:21,T7,First,Offline, Do you?
P29,00:22:27,T7,First,Offline, Yeah. 
P31,00:22:31,T7,First,Offline,It's not my favourite to be honest. I will put it here
P32,00:22:35,T7,First,Offline, We know no body will use it
P30,00:22:37,T7,First,Offline, Do you think this is app is better?
P29,00:22:41,T7,First,Offline, Do you like the weather stuff?
P30,00:22:45,T7,First,Offline, The weather. You like the weather project?
P32,00:22:47,T7,First,Offline, Yeah
P29,00:22:51,T7,First,Offline, Do you remember that we all talked about the disadvantages on that app?
P31,00:22:54,T7,First,Offline, Why?
P32,00:23:03,T7,First,Offline, Why?
P31,00:23:08,T7,First,Offline, Because it's an extended app
P32,00:23:10,T7,First,Offline, I would not see that I prefer to. This one is about senses which is from Innovation Centre for Sensing Imaging and IoT Systems based in Glasgow. So they want
P31,00:23:11,T7,First,Offline, I like that
P29,00:23:17,T7,First,Offline,3D Smart Camera for evaluate the shape size and volume of boxes or items
P31,00:23:26,T7,First,Offline, Do we use someone else's module for the image recognition or we have to make our own?
P30,00:23:28,T7,First,Offline, Software development environments can include Python
P31,00:23:31,T7,First,Offline, I feel this a bit difficult
P30,00:23:33,T7,First,Offline, Long range wireless sensors
P31,00:23:35,T7,First,Offline, Yeah
P29,00:23:37,T7,First,Offline, I don't know
P31,00:23:39,T7,First,Offline, I mean Image recognition
P31,00:23:41,T7,First,Offline, We don't know what kind of data we need to get
P29,00:23:43,T7,First,Offline, This one is encryption project
P29,00:23:44,T7,First,Offline, Oh
P29,00:23:47,T7,First,Offline, So it's OBASHI to work with data flow exports. So they do like data visualisation. So they are working with a charity in the USA
P31,00:23:48,T7,First,Offline, So it will be image recognition again?
P30,00:23:50,T7,First,Offline, I think so
P31,00:23:52,T7,First,Offline, Do we have to decide what project now?
P29,00:23:54,T7,First,Offline, No no no
P32,00:23:55,T7,First,Offline, How do you define success?
P29,00:23:57,T7,First,Offline, success? If you got Maserati
P31,00:24:00,T7,First,Offline, Ok. Success in the context of team project that means we will handle it will and even if we did not meet at the end the milestones
P30,00:24:02,T7,First,Offline, I think we need to look at it for which project though
P31,00:24:04,T7,First,Offline, For which project
P29,00:24:11,T7,First,Offline, I feel we need more about information to know about the projects. My only issue is that I don't know if I can deal with the other projects
P31,00:24:14,T7,First,Offline, The apps stuff?
P29,00:24:16,T7,First,Offline, Yeah I don't if I can acutely do it
P31,00:24:18,T7,First,Offline, I can handle anything Java so.
P32,00:24:21,T7,First,Offline, I know that's not what I mean
P29,00:24:24,T7,First,Offline, Yeah for integrating you don't want to start on one foot
P32,00:24:27,T7,First,Offline, Yeah
P29,00:24:28,T7,First,Offline, But the integration stuff 
P32,00:24:32,T7,First,Offline, I think we goanna have some issues with that
P29,00:24:36,T7,First,Offline, yeah
P32,00:24:39,T7,First,Offline, How dose those system work?
P29,00:24:43,T7,First,Offline, I think it just an algorithm or something
P30,00:24:47,T7,First,Offline, Ok they know nothing about us
P32,00:24:50,T7,First,Offline, Actually I know some people from the privacy that they told that you trust the company
P30,00:24:52,T7,First,Offline, Only some
P33,00:24:54,T7,First,Offline, That was the question
P31,00:24:57,T7,First,Offline, Is this our dissertation?
P32,00:25:00,T7,First,Offline, This?
P33,00:25:01,T7,First,Offline, This not
P30,00:25:04,T7,First,Offline, But the dissertation we give individual project 
P32,00:25:05,T7,First,Offline, What exactly you mean personal?
P30,00:25:07,T7,First,Offline, You know next they called solo project 
P33,00:25:09,T7,First,Offline, I think it is team project
P30,00:25:12,T7,First,Offline, Are you doing CS honours?
P33,00:25:17,T7,First,Offline, Sorry?
P30,00:25:18,T7,First,Offline, Are you doing CS honours?
P33,00:25:20,T7,First,Offline, Yeah Yeah
P30,00:25:22,T7,First,Offline, Okay. You goanna take the team project this year and the next year you're goanna do the project on your own
P31,00:25:28,T7,First,Offline, Yeah yeah
P33,00:25:31,T7,First,Offline, Are we good?
P30,00:25:37,T7,First,Offline, I'm good
P30,00:25:40,T7,First,Offline, yeah
P3,00:00:00,T1,First,Offline,I feel like we should start talking or else we're gonna be here forever.
P2,00:00:05,T1,First,Offline,"So, what was it? What are you interested in?"
P4,00:00:12,T1,First,Offline,I can like the sensor one seems quite.
P2,00:00:14,T1,First,Offline,Sensor one?
P4,00:00:14,T1,First,Offline,Yeah.
P2,00:00:17,T1,First,Offline,What was that like again?
P4,00:00:23,T1,First,Offline,It's the image recognition?
P5,00:00:25,T1,First,Offline,That's a bit ambiguous
P3,00:00:33,T1,First,Offline,"I thought would be simple pain management one it's not a lot like feedback, it's just like information on an app."
P2,00:00:42,T1,First,Offline,There is that as well but then that teaching one. I'm not sure if you seen what was that like? it was like basically Yonkers.
P5,00:00:50,T1,First,Offline,Yeah
P2,00:00:51,T1,First,Offline,That's it. That looks kind of interesting
P5,00:00:52,T1,First,Offline,It's good if it crashes
P2,00:00:52,T1,First,Offline,"Yeah, but this is going to like an app rather than."
P5,00:01:11,T1,First,Offline,There are few app like really simple
P4,00:01:20,T1,First,Offline,The Chronic pain was also just information on the app and then a pain dairy sounds.
P2,00:01:27,T1,First,Offline,"That was a medicine kind of prescription kind of, wasn't it? like seeing like what had allergies to."
P3,00:01:36,T1,First,Offline,"That's was antibiotics, but the one he is talking about is like chronic pain management where you like put in which page."
P1,00:01:48,T1,First,Offline,Lessons you can click on.
P2,00:01:55,T1,First,Offline,I feel like write that down. I have read it. I know.
P1,00:02:03,T1,First,Offline,"That was the first thing, such a read need to be"
P2,00:02:05,T1,First,Offline,"Okay, so which once?"
P3,00:02:06,T1,First,Offline,There some which I think they were confusing us.
P2,00:02:06,T1,First,Offline,Those are the Shakespeare one that I hated
P1,00:02:06,T1,First,Offline,Yeah. I'm like fine
P2,00:02:50,T1,First,Offline,This is just telling people like if they have a chronic pain and then giving them help on that pain.
P1,00:02:54,T1,First,Offline,Yeah.
P3,00:02:55,T1,First,Offline,I think it's like they've been diagnosed by.
P2,00:02:57,T1,First,Offline,Yeah.
P3,00:02:58,T1,First,Offline,Like the doctor.
P2,00:03:16,T1,First,Offline,Which ones have you said will be the easiest to reside Yakers kind of coffee one?
P1,00:03:19,T1,First,Offline,"Yeah, there is that one there is the Yakers."
P3,00:03:37,T1,First,Offline,"Well, there's this one that app for Prince's Trust that let you see events and give feedback. That could be pretty simple."
P4,00:03:59,T1,First,Offline,The one that was done that she just for monitoring who's there and he is not in terms of having files stuff.
P2,00:04:16,T1,First,Offline,I was thinking of that as well. They only they could get access to after scanning paper that they have to sing them.
P3,00:04:30,T1,First,Offline,"That's for eyes only, I think."
P5,00:04:47,T1,First,Offline,Alright which one's are interesting?
P4,00:04:48,T1,First,Offline,That one
P3,00:04:49,T1,First,Offline,That one is not really hard to read
P5,00:04:49,T1,First,Offline,Yeah. the ones are like that.
P2,00:05:02,T1,First,Offline,"I know what are you talking about, the Wilson charity kind of thing"
P5,00:05:02,T1,First,Offline,There's a smaller one look just like that without the spacing It was horrible.
P2,00:05:13,T1,First,Offline,"This one is well, actually, I just maybe one is what I was interesting. Oh, yeah, this is the  Yankers one. We'll put that here, so this is quicker technology."
P1,00:05:26,T1,First,Offline,So originally for easy pile and interesting pile.
P2,00:05:33,T1,First,Offline,I don't know. I think the Yankers can almost kind of interesting to me but it's little bit easy. I'm not sure. This one is prescribing medicines
P3,00:06:02,T1,First,Offline,I'm not really sure what they wanted.
P2,00:06:06,T1,First,Offline,The Wilson was where's that?
P3,00:06:08,T1,First,Offline,This one
P2,00:06:14,T1,First,Offline,All right. This a huge one
P3,00:06:17,T1,First,Offline,"I thought one was good, just the terms of how they laid out what they wanted."
P2,00:06:23,T1,First,Offline,Yes. Actually I just want it yeah.
P2,00:06:27,T1,First,Offline,So like these kind of maybe easy pile and then that's like the interesting pile.
P3,00:06:43,T1,First,Offline,This is the one with the ball rebound tight on sport surface.
P2,00:06:46,T1,First,Offline,"Oh, yeah. That one actually that's quite interesting but I don't know how exactly implement. This is taking the taking the audio is being hang the ball down and just waiting for it to come back down exactly."
P1,00:07:03,T1,First,Offline,You mean the sound?
P2,00:07:03,T1,First,Offline,Yeah that's relatively easy looking as well.
P4,00:07:07,T1,First,Offline,I know we'd have to actually do is match the sound and then just mock the times between them.
P2,00:07:16,T1,First,Offline,Once I understand sounds like that's kind of interesting.
P4,00:07:21,T1,First,Offline,Although I bet it wouldn't be that easy.
P2,00:07:24,T1,First,Offline,"It's not gonna be that easy. Absolutely. It wouldn't fit on this year. So oh yeah Willson one basically just an app on what they're doing and why they're doing it and stuff like that, wasn't it?"
P1,00:07:37,T1,First,Offline,I think so.
P2,00:07:37,T1,First,Offline,"So yeah. Understand if you just not try to do it as well. So it's kind of interesting. Yeah, so basically those are the kind of once we kind of make want to be interesting."
P3,00:08:08,T1,First,Offline,Could we pick a couple of them to answer the questions?
P2,00:08:18,T1,First,Offline,"So answer couple of questions. What are the objectives?  So the objective of the Wilson one to put an app, basically a visor app for that. Wasn't' it?"
P3,00:08:32,T1,First,Offline,Yes
P2,00:08:35,T1,First,Offline,So that's though an app. It's basically a social network that kind of is telling them what's happening on certain things. How do you define success for the Wilson?
P1,00:09:14,T1,First,Offline,What?
P2,00:09:17,T1,First,Offline,How did how would you define success with us kind of one. Have you read that Wilson one?
P1,00:09:22,T1,First,Offline,"Yeah, I have read that. What you mean to define success?"
P2,00:09:25,T1,First,Offline,"Yeah, so like."
P4,00:09:25,T1,First,Offline,That what it says on on the sheet.
P2,00:09:30,T1,First,Offline,To me just an app.
P1,00:09:31,T1,First,Offline,"But they got the objective, are they?"
P2,00:09:35,T1,First,Offline,They got the objectives there. So it's just fulfilling.
P1,00:09:37,T1,First,Offline,"Yeah, obviously I can see that's why."
P2,00:09:38,T1,First,Offline,"Yeah,."
P4,00:09:38,T1,First,Offline,Makes clients happy.
P2,00:09:48,T1,First,Offline,What are the implication of the project doesn't succeed?
P3,00:09:59,T1,First,Offline,We wouldn't have answer. It's like a horrible indication
P2,00:10:10,T1,First,Offline,This is just people don't know exactly what's happening or be able to socialize with the most sensible.
P1,00:10:19,T1,First,Offline,I feel this app is a pain diary.
P2,00:10:24,T1,First,Offline,Why is the project so important?
P3,00:10:31,T1,First,Offline,The Project's this one's not like critical.
P2,00:10:34,T1,First,Offline,"Yeah, it's not critical, but it's like is to encourage like young people to like go to these centers. so get help."
P1,00:10:43,T1,First,Offline,It has to do a new expansion they are saying. They like changing the way they work here in  Center Glasgow.
P1,00:10:51,T1,First,Offline,Yes.
P2,00:10:51,T1,First,Offline,Put an app
P4,00:10:51,T1,First,Offline,You see what's useful further like that will like everyone else.
P3,00:10:59,T1,First,Offline,It's more convenience to users.
P2,00:11:03,T1,First,Offline,"We're just going to be the days that we have to Showcase that we have. So like I forgot the dates, but so those will be important dates key Milestones are just whenever like I for meeting the client every week. That's a that's a milestone just to see like oh we have to improve by next week unless so we have to like fix us up. So that's just a few milestones."
P4,00:11:39,T1,First,Offline,"Set the midway point, if you're on the midway there by time, that sounds met"
P2,00:11:40,T1,First,Offline,Yeah. Or like even further than the midway we hopefully.
P4,00:11:43,T1,First,Offline,But yeah.
P3,00:11:44,T1,First,Offline,Have each function I guess as a milestone
P2,00:11:44,T1,First,Offline,So those like so for number four is just going to be the same for all of them.
P5,00:11:53,T1,First,Offline,Yeah.
P2,00:11:53,T1,First,Offline,Important decisions that need to be made will prevent us from making those decisions? For decisions to be made we just need to meet up. That's one thing or talk online like if I send Discord link which I keep forgetting to do. If I send discord link that has a voice chat and stuff like that so we can use that before we make any decisions or like do Anything by ourselves and I sense a little like so that's a way to just tell everyone what's happening or just with church texture encourage a discussion are there and other times other things that may prevent as a just not being able to contact the client for being us from like doing that.
P4,00:12:40,T1,First,Offline,In terms of what we terrified of that right now
P2,00:12:43,T1,First,Offline,We should be terrified of that. That's the worst-case scenario. One of the most important decisions that we need to do. Just team roles. We saw certain items and different roles. Like wasn't that person digital is a sphere and we were just like everyone does whatever.
P1,00:13:02,T1,First,Offline,Yeah.
P2,00:13:03,T1,First,Offline,"Kind of like we kind of discussed that like, we're still going to discuss it. But this is everyone could just do whatever they want. But I'm not sure that's the most organized way. It kind makes harder to research what needs to be done."
P1,00:13:15,T1,First,Offline,What languages probably pretty important.
P2,00:13:17,T1,First,Offline,Hummm
P1,00:13:16,T1,First,Offline,What languages we're using is probably very important.
P2,00:13:20,T1,First,Offline,"Yeah, that's excellent point as well."
P4,00:13:22,T1,First,Offline,I think it depends on the project
P2,00:13:22,T1,First,Offline,Some have like specific specific things for like this for like apps we should just look at your app language or specs for that or like so maybe that's where may be restricted in that like Python might not work well with apps or C would not or something like that.
P1,00:13:47,T1,First,Offline,C would great for apps.
P2,00:13:48,T1,First,Offline,"I don't know, I'm just making that up."
P4,00:13:49,T1,First,Offline,I'm just going to say usually Java.
P2,00:13:52,T1,First,Offline,Yeah is bit better.
P4,00:13:52,T1,First,Offline,iOS is now Swift used to be something else.
P2,00:13:58,T1,First,Offline,"Yeah, so we have to convert it."
P4,00:13:58,T1,First,Offline,"Or you can use web Technologies and they work on all of them, which is my favorite way to slightly slow so."
P2,00:14:05,T1,First,Offline,That might be a good so that's that's of those are important for app development loans so that be like for the clicker one of them lately and teaching clicking basically Yaker system. Who are the key stakeholders?
P4,00:14:24,T1,First,Offline,I think in order the amount that stakeholders just the people who opposed them.
P2,00:14:30,T1,First,Offline,"Yeah, the people that either they work for or."
P3,00:14:32,T1,First,Offline,"They're not, so people are using them."
P2,00:14:34,T1,First,Offline,"Yeah,  Projects of greatest assets. What does that mean?"
P1,00:14:45,T1,First,Offline,Best things about the project
P2,00:14:49,T1,First,Offline,"It's relatively like the project plans look at the project plan for this Wilson one is quite detailed and thorough. So it's like he's also worked with a team last year and he said it didn't go like properly successful because it crashed the server and all that, but if he has experience with that we can say like can we actually pick good person to work with."
P1,00:15:10,T1,First,Offline,Or someone who knows what he wants.
P2,00:15:13,T1,First,Offline,"Yeah, this is cool."
P3,00:15:13,T1,First,Offline,We also are  just judging from the different proposals you can tell who cares and who is just sort of doing it.
P2,00:15:20,T1,First,Offline,Yeah like those sort of people that wrote it on notepad.
P3,00:15:22,T1,First,Offline,I think is this one it's notepad and he's not space to it. It just words.
P2,00:15:38,T1,First,Offline,"Then, that what's heckley based leverage those nonsense.  We have just discussed that really."
P4,00:15:50,T1,First,Offline,Also known proposed by like development teams as well. So they go like some expertise. I think some of them have existing systems you can like work with
P2,00:16:02,T1,First,Offline,Yeah.
P4,00:16:04,T1,First,Offline,Yeah comic book.
P2,00:16:08,T1,First,Offline,What are the most important areas we should always focus on? Important is communication and evidently that's key to the project.
P1,00:16:24,T1,First,Offline,The Project?
P2,00:16:30,T1,First,Offline,"Mostly communication then just like learning and knowing exactly what you're doing. So like that considers that comes into communication as well, and all kind. But yeah, this is researching and stuff like that and that's important area."
P1,00:16:47,T1,First,Offline,Teamwork. Probably pretty important as well.
P2,00:16:49,T1,First,Offline,Yeah kind of.
P1,00:16:51,T1,First,Offline,Communicate but not do it and that's pretty shake.
P2,00:16:59,T1,First,Offline,And that's basically all I can think of right now time to terms of important areas for the important areas of like some of the project still has like exactly this pile up until I can was needed for the app or whatever and then was kind of like if this is possible then to this as well. So like maybe we should focus on like the areas are we need to get done and then focus on the other ones. To see if the other ones are even possible Zone. How much are you how much risk are you willing to take to accomplish this?
P1,00:17:36,T1,First,Offline,Not.
P2,00:17:38,T1,First,Offline,Yeah.
P3,00:17:39,T1,First,Offline,How much sleep are you willing to lose over this?
P2,00:17:39,T1,First,Offline,"In terms of rest, no social life. That's basically what I have heard from third-year."
P1,00:17:39,T1,First,Offline,Not really
P2,00:17:47,T1,First,Offline,"I guess the rest is just me being able to prioritize things. To say like when it needs to get done and stuff like that, like oh and another cabin social life is fine. As long as people the better work on that you think you need to get done. So taking rest was just seeing I start to go this. Whether like like to sleep to go outside or whatever. I would like everyone's posting like the music like interleague known how they one of the options sleep and it's good studying or like a good education or have a social life was like all the picture of the three kind of thing. I guess I would have money so I can impress like shirk."
P1,00:18:42,T1,First,Offline,You'r risk your social life.
P2,00:18:44,T1,First,Offline,"Yeah, socially for sleep program, so I guess those are the risks. I'm having to take time to just make sure this gets done. Maybe, I don't think there's many other risks that we would take we wouldn't sacrifice like other subjects for it because that's basically vital to the subjects get those credits. Sometimes maybe my selector first recorded me."
P2,00:19:15,T1,First,Offline,Make algorithms that had a recored.
P1,00:19:19,T1,First,Offline,Recorded?
P2,00:19:20,T1,First,Offline,"There's also Interactive systems, I don't think we'll be ready. I don't know."
P5,00:19:29,T1,First,Offline,I haven't seen anyone who really is.
P2,00:19:31,T1,First,Offline,"Yeah, but then there's like the other one that's good."
P1,00:19:39,T1,First,Offline,Because I did not pay any attention. Started like falling out of consciousness.
P2,00:19:44,T1,First,Offline,"So yeah, so in terms of missing lectures we can do that sometimes if it's necessary, but not enough to make sure we have time to counsel buttons of what barriers have you encountered in the past about this issue? Barriers so in terms of teamwork and stuff like that. That'll be like last year's web project maybe what happened then anything bad still?"
P1,00:20:17,T1,First,Offline,One guy didn't turn out.
P2,00:20:17,T1,First,Offline,Yeah.
P3,00:20:18,T1,First,Offline,One of my teammates just didn't do work until week before it was due.
P2,00:20:21,T1,First,Offline,My guy in my one of my team isn't the day before was due and if they don't think that was like the user tests and they did a wrong answer we got like B.
P4,00:20:30,T1,First,Offline,Was working against us as well as like he was pushing old codes some how. Sounds like I'm doing everything I did and he never actually finishes still I want ended it so.
P2,00:20:45,T1,First,Offline,So I guess we have to make sure everyone gets their bed done and Isis.
P1,00:20:50,T1,First,Offline,Yeah.
P2,00:20:51,T1,First,Offline,That's not like most that may be identical easy fear kind of the first guy interesting like everyone doing whatever they want to do. You can somehow of like seem like I'm a clash with whatever someone else is.
P1,00:21:04,T1,First,Offline,Still making sure was doing stuff.
P2,00:21:08,T1,First,Offline,Yeah. It's have someone like this is all of us could keep an eye on each other.
P4,00:21:16,T1,First,Offline,You can see who's falling behind.
P2,00:21:19,T1,First,Offline,"Yeah,."
P4,00:21:19,T1,First,Offline,or who is not commenting.
P2,00:21:21,T1,First,Offline,"So if you discuss the team things, so maybe we could go next Wednesday discuss what kind of team kind of management we want to do."
P3,00:21:29,T1,First,Offline,"Also, I guess everyone has to be realistic about what they can actually do take on."
P2,00:21:52,T1,First,Offline,What keeps you up at night? There is about of time I have heard of like people are freaking dead because of the projects.
P1,00:22:02,T1,First,Offline,You're scaring me guys.
P2,00:22:08,T1,First,Offline,I'm already there. So that's my words. What else makes worry about the project?
P4,00:22:26,T1,First,Offline,"For the most part lie. I used to work in software development for a few years and whenever we go close to a deadline, you know, everyone would just hang wrong with it. I have enough faith for you guys that will get this done. So I think we'll be fine."
P5,00:22:42,T1,First,Offline,Yeah. The biggest stressful thing is about client if they're helpful or not
P2,00:22:48,T1,First,Offline,That's just to build up the stress as well.
P1,00:22:53,T1,First,Offline,"But I'm fine man, I'm not too stressed. We got a good team."
P2,00:22:57,T1,First,Offline,That's kind of false dedication
P1,00:23:01,T1,First,Offline,"Well, I think project was fine. All of us are nice, so I'm not going to read bad Karma."
P2,00:23:08,T1,First,Offline,"Yeah, that's good. What topics haven't we discussed. What would you rather not discuss? We already mentioned the topics would rather not discuss."
P5,00:23:25,T1,First,Offline,So that we can discuss it
P2,00:23:25,T1,First,Offline,Exactly. I guess we can ignore that kind of question. We have decided what kind of project to want to do.
P1,00:23:38,T1,First,Offline,Promise is going to be about it. So there's a good chance. We're not getting what we want.
P2,00:23:42,T1,First,Offline,Awesome.
P3,00:23:43,T1,First,Offline,There's no point in the seeing them for Hamish be able to like request which one we want.
P2,00:23:49,T1,First,Offline,Yeah if people go for the same one that just random generator from them?
P1,00:23:55,T1,First,Offline,I think so
P2,00:23:55,T1,First,Offline,Yeah. What is your personal passion about the project?
P5,00:24:03,T1,First,Offline,Getting it done.
P2,00:24:04,T1,First,Offline,That's my passion passion.
P4,00:24:16,T1,First,Offline,Getting in to fourth year
P2,00:24:16,T1,First,Offline,"It depends on the project we're going to do. So for instance. If you have the die, it will not like the pain one is like slightly more important so that you know people might be waiting for that and relying on it. And so I guess that's a certain passion."
P3,00:24:28,T1,First,Offline,If Someone not just sort of the free labor for.
P4,00:24:34,T1,First,Offline,Yeah. So that kind of went good. I think so personal passion will depend on projects and.
P4,00:24:44,T1,First,Offline,At least one of them suggested the hiring someone from the team if we do a good job.
P2,00:24:49,T1,First,Offline,"Oh, yeah."
P1,00:24:51,T1,First,Offline,"Wait, which one is that?"
P2,00:24:51,T1,First,Offline,There was like one or two people they were saying we can hire for an internship.
P1,00:24:51,T1,First,Offline,Alright
P2,00:24:59,T1,First,Offline,"I don't know like I read that one but I was not interested in the project but It look crazy I think , oh this like I wasn't interested."
P4,00:25:07,T1,First,Offline,"I think any of the time specifically demand the IP. That probably be looking for helping managing it anyway, so there's always that potential."
P2,00:25:20,T1,First,Offline,My own question for project don't you want?
P1,00:25:26,T1,First,Offline,So I like really dry medical ones seem like.
P2,00:25:30,T1,First,Offline,The medical ones there I don't even I like image.
P1,00:25:35,T1,First,Offline,Shakespeare?
P2,00:25:34,T1,First,Offline,"Yeah Shakespeare,  I did not have to say much because like I don't fully understand it either. It's like yeah, so I don't want that one. If you guys got stuck with that one already and you manage."
P1,00:25:54,T1,First,Offline,I dont't think anyone will take that one
P2,00:25:54,T1,First,Offline,I think that's mostly everything discussed. Anything else is anyone want to say about any project?
P1,00:26:04,T1,First,Offline,No.
P2,00:26:04,T1,First,Offline,]Then that's it. Let's go
P25,00:00:10,T6,First,Offline,"Okay, the feels like each page is one project."
P26,00:00:13,T6,First,Offline,"Yeah, it is."
P25,00:00:14,T6,First,Offline,Okay.
P26,00:00:14,T6,First,Offline,Just keep through it quick.
P27,00:00:20,T6,First,Offline,Yeah.
P25,00:00:27,T6,First,Offline,I think perhaps we should like separate ones that we think quite like to do.
P26,00:00:32,T6,First,Offline,Yeah.
P25,00:00:32,T6,First,Offline,But like one file I don't really understand.
P27,00:03:07,T6,First,Offline,It is a kind of a hard.
P25,00:03:11,T6,First,Offline,So it like the decryption on your phone so like on paper some of the things were encrypted when you view it's really like your smartphone camera it will decrypts.
P27,00:03:29,T6,First,Offline,Oh really?
P26,00:03:29,T6,First,Offline,That's nice.
P27,00:04:53,T6,First,Offline,This one is so generic could be like everything. These ones are asking for iOS or Android app in the seems kind of advanced. I mean.
P25,00:06:54,T6,First,Offline,That seems kind of advanced?
P27,00:06:56,T6,First,Offline,Yeah.
P25,00:06:57,T6,First,Offline,"I mean. Usually like I mean Android developers sudden Java or kotlin which are like easy peasy. Like I did like I did try to do some over the summer. An IOS Swift is this very object-oriented based whereas Swift is a little more functional but yeah,."
P27,00:07:19,T6,First,Offline,It's not this hard.
P25,00:07:21,T6,First,Offline,It's not that hard but it's not exactly the most inspiring of problems making app
P27,00:07:45,T6,First,Offline,"If you like, you have theses"
P25,00:12:28,T6,First,Offline,"Anyway, I'm just giving you all the ones that I don't like okay."
P26,00:12:33,T6,First,Offline,These are all for various reasons.
P25,00:16:40,T6,First,Offline,I see that that you have the same idea there.
P26,00:17:00,T6,First,Offline,I Feel like we should pass to answers some questions.
P27,00:17:04,T6,First,Offline,Yeah
P25,00:17:04,T6,First,Offline,I mean my pile is pretty big but maybe everyone should just like say one or two projects they liked.
P27,00:17:12,T6,First,Offline,Yeah.
P26,00:17:13,T6,First,Offline,And then we continue.
P25,00:17:16,T6,First,Offline,I mean I told you already but the smartphone and decryption one.
P26,00:17:25,T6,First,Offline,Is it like Google Translate for encryption data into the data?
P25,00:17:34,T6,First,Offline,"Yeah. So I mean we're going to use you use the Google translate like grammar saying things like that that exactly fit like your decrypting the stuff. That's kind of nice. It's also quite simple like, yeah, I could like that one."
P27,00:18:06,T6,First,Offline,I mean like one problem with that app could be that maybe  is hard to decrypt data because we kind of data do we have like what's like the encryption format?
P26,00:18:15,T6,First,Offline,"Well, that should be pretty easy."
P27,00:18:19,T6,First,Offline,Is it?
P25,00:18:22,T6,First,Offline,"I mean, I guess so but like the timing on an app it should be bart two to the actual decryption in the first place. I think that her far as like the actual image processing itself. Just say how it works. I mean. Any projects that you could like?"
P27,00:18:47,T6,First,Offline,Maybe these too but like the problem is that I don't know. I don't know where to start. I think that they're going to give us like the guidelines or something because otherwise.
P26,00:19:33,T6,First,Offline,I mean there's a few things that I'm a bit of a sucker for which is like an embedded application like the some of the stern one's getting pretty fun.  There is also like some of the more machine learning is like it was a lot of it seems to be machine learning.
P27,00:19:53,T6,First,Offline,Yeah
P26,00:19:53,T6,First,Offline,"Like I don't mind the apps on the apps like sort of code. This one is a bit of a weird one just like neural network based game that on like the air that's been done before by other projects on their backs. So it seems to be running things. It seems to be quite popular. Yeah, but I don't should be should be pick one and go through the questions and then."
P27,00:20:18,T6,First,Offline,Yeah that's fine
P26,00:20:23,T6,First,Offline,Try to give a look at this one. I don't know if maybe it could be interesting because it's like related to the thing like machine learning visualization stuff like that.
P25,00:20:36,T6,First,Offline,The only thing I got was this might be quite hard. A lot of these are like facial recognition elements Vehicles exciting processing for navigation both lane detection.
P27,00:20:49,T6,First,Offline,This like depends on like.
P25,00:20:51,T6,First,Offline,I know I know
P27,00:20:51,T6,First,Offline,"It depends of what they give you I mean, but this like is valid for all the projects."
P25,00:21:02,T6,First,Offline,And then there's like a lot of database stuff.
P28,00:21:34,T6,First,Offline,I remember reading it as well.
P25,00:21:40,T6,First,Offline,Yeah.
P28,00:21:41,T6,First,Offline,That would be good.
P25,00:21:41,T6,First,Offline,"Yeah, because it kind of is talking about like Liberian as well as like some Hardware Electronics like. Also, I quite like her attitude because it was like like I went to start assembling their work, like wanting to get this really well done. Should we like talk about this one then?"
P26,00:22:21,T6,First,Offline,What's the questions?
P25,00:22:35,T6,First,Offline,"What are the objectives? How do you defend success? Extend existing in bringing a functionality. Yeah, so I think I think some of the objectives would be like getting within the system itself because clearly like this is already an up and running system. So like anything one of it would be just getting used to like an understanding how it works at. This is also quite weird as well. This can be broadly fall into different Avenues and giving each student their own piece of work."
P26,00:23:16,T6,First,Offline,So we just feel like if I guess I know but like that's sort of Interest.
P28,00:23:24,T6,First,Offline,"I mean improvements to the mm course, we have these different things, right? So we have the actual processing the actual engine itself and how it applies to the other systems development and payment and functionality. So other tasks that are hardware making sure that tested okay development of external support integration capability. This one thing I don't know much about that."
P27,00:23:57,T6,First,Offline,Or even where to start.
P25,00:24:01,T6,First,Offline,So like I think knowing the system first of all and then I think one of the objectives would just be at the end like the test of the whole system works because it seems like they want something finished like yeah.
P28,00:24:18,T6,First,Offline,"I don't know. How would you define it when we like, how would you define that? We were successful?"
P25,00:24:29,T6,First,Offline,Okay
P27,00:24:31,T6,First,Offline,If like our system is completely integrated with our system and it works.
P25,00:24:36,T6,First,Offline,"Yeah, because you're right because it seemed because we integrate it."
P27,00:24:42,T6,First,Offline,Yes.
P25,00:24:42,T6,First,Offline,The rest of system no point making and so on then if it becomes a team project for somebody year and they have integrate it.
P26,00:24:47,T6,First,Offline,Yeah.
P25,00:24:47,T6,First,Offline,Yeah. What these areas are you interested in?
P27,00:25:09,T6,First,Offline,"Well, actually all these here are interesting I mean we need a second one."
P25,00:25:20,T6,First,Offline,What the alteration?
P27,00:25:22,T6,First,Offline,Yeah.
P25,00:25:22,T6,First,Offline,It's something we haven't really done any like doing some sort of core engine.
P27,00:25:30,T6,First,Offline,Yeah.
P25,00:25:30,T6,First,Offline,"Yeah. All right, if the project doesn't succeed what are the implications? Obviously we fail if the course exactly. I don't think there's that many large-scale applications because they already have."
P27,00:25:49,T6,First,Offline,Yeah
P25,00:25:49,T6,First,Offline,Various thing it would just be we're failure and we haven't really done.
P28,00:25:54,T6,First,Offline,Do we all know C++?
P25,00:25:56,T6,First,Offline,No.
P28,00:25:58,T6,First,Offline,"I know get that ribbon. No, I'm not a pro."
P25,00:26:01,T6,First,Offline,I mean.
P26,00:26:04,T6,First,Offline,We're going to better systems program about.
P28,00:26:05,T6,First,Offline,"Well, how hard is it for you."
P28,00:26:15,T6,First,Offline,I'm pretty good with C and you know objects this much.
P26,00:26:18,T6,First,Offline,okay It's quite a complicated language a huge different ways to do. It seemed like just a completely I remember losing weight. Someone kind of hit was critiquing it. They're just like when the big deal because he was supposed to come up with it. So they just do some problems based on anything.
P25,00:26:48,T6,First,Offline,"Hmm. So there are many implications. I'm glad you know C++ because I'm gonna be like, yes, we have a person of interest in C++. Why is this project so important? What is the case for change? As they said."
P26,00:27:10,T6,First,Offline,I think one of the things was they just wanted it it in more platforms.
P27,00:27:13,T6,First,Offline,Yeah.
P26,00:27:14,T6,First,Offline,The other things that are really know alterations.
P28,00:27:26,T6,First,Offline,It's generally just expanse. The project overall.
P27,00:27:30,T6,First,Offline,Yeah
P25,00:27:34,T6,First,Offline,So making it more ubiquitous and probably doing some improvements at the same time.
P27,00:27:38,T6,First,Offline,Yeah.
P25,00:27:38,T6,First,Offline,Okay. What are the key Milestones? What are the important dates?
P26,00:27:45,T6,First,Offline,"Well, if you were to pick one of these. What would you think would be milestones?"
P27,00:27:53,T6,First,Offline,"Well, it has to be compatible with like all the different platforms. So it's like very important."
P25,00:28:00,T6,First,Offline,Yeah for making an iteration a core or that's correct.
P26,00:28:04,T6,First,Offline,So it would probably probably be something like close to 1 at time like one platform at a time.
P27,00:28:12,T6,First,Offline,"Yeah,."
P26,00:28:13,T6,First,Offline,Or one feature at a time. It just faces based on.
P27,00:28:18,T6,First,Offline,In large selling. This country sometime.
P25,00:28:20,T6,First,Offline,What are the most important things that need to be made will prevent us from making those decisions. No idea.
P26,00:28:42,T6,First,Offline,I think I think it for making a new feature that we have to implement that to accommodate for all the other platforms. And any other decision that you think could be
P27,00:29:18,T6,First,Offline,Depends on how the project is going important decisions.
P25,00:29:34,T6,First,Offline,Probably when we test this a decision. Like how long is this testing in each stage is going to be and then the thing that would stop us from making that as if you don't have access to everything like the facilities or whatever especially for this one were something that for other Machinery.
P26,00:29:54,T6,First,Offline,Yeah.
P27,00:29:57,T6,First,Offline,What are the biggest obstacles getting this done C++ ? No
P28,00:30:06,T6,First,Offline,Waiting on the cliffs toward.
P26,00:30:07,T6,First,Offline,Any real obstacles?
P27,00:30:23,T6,First,Offline,"Yeah, it's something that like making a product of this compatible with all different operating systems."
P26,00:30:29,T6,First,Offline,Yeah.
P27,00:30:29,T6,First,Offline,"Yeah, just learning the system in the first place."
P25,00:30:33,T6,First,Offline,Also I assume an issue with also be like we can change any of the other platforms.
P27,00:30:41,T6,First,Offline,No exactly so it depends like what kind of information they need to give us.
P25,00:30:43,T6,First,Offline,Yeah.
P27,00:30:45,T6,First,Offline,"Also, like for the improvements to the existing Hardware like we perception standing."
P25,00:30:54,T6,First,Offline,Here are the key stakeholders is owner who influences here's a potential to be an obstacle.
P26,00:31:12,T6,First,Offline,The stakeholders are pretty much everyone uses it but dose it say who own it?
P28,00:31:19,T6,First,Offline,I don't know
P25,00:31:30,T6,First,Offline,What are the Project's greatest assets?
P26,00:31:46,T6,First,Offline,"I think it's the people who are the customers the fact that they say and passion to learn new tricks. It seems like they want to teach us as much as we learn. But I also think it's the capability of Yeah, I just think it's a supportive role because it's just way so much so many people."
P28,00:32:13,T6,First,Offline,There will be shortage of places to go.
P25,00:32:16,T6,First,Offline,Anything else? How can we best leverage those assets? Probably take this object that can get into some but also.
P26,00:32:46,T6,First,Offline,Probably just talking to the customers right?.
P25,00:32:48,T6,First,Offline,What are the most important areas we should always focus on?  I don't know what it means by that.
P28,00:33:03,T6,First,Offline,Regarding this project I mean is
P27,00:33:14,T6,First,Offline,"Yeah, we have to learn what you're using."
P25,00:33:16,T6,First,Offline,Yeah.
P27,00:33:17,T6,First,Offline,And a great integration.
P26,00:33:18,T6,First,Offline,Yeah.
P25,00:33:18,T6,First,Offline,How much risk are you willing to take to accomplish this? Yeah. Well.
P28,00:33:26,T6,First,Offline,I'm feeling tracking systems of come on context longer very obvious perhaps interactive systems some work in this longer.
P25,00:33:32,T6,First,Offline,"Fair enough to you're ready to take the risk of your degree. Yeah, like I'm going to put as many tiny refer to this one. What barriers are being encountered in the past about this issue? We haven't done any of that. Okay, what keeps you up at night about this."
P28,00:33:57,T6,First,Offline,C++
P25,00:34:02,T6,First,Offline,"Also if it is overwhelming. I feel like I mean, we're still only five people. So."
P26,00:34:07,T6,First,Offline,Yeah.
P25,00:34:08,T6,First,Offline,What topics haven't we discussed? What topics would you rather not discussed? I think it means in the questions themselves.
P26,00:34:32,T6,First,Offline,Oh really.
P25,00:34:34,T6,First,Offline,Like I think we haven't discussed like how much Choice there is within the church. The project has been many ones there. I think also if it doesn't really talk about does it really talk about how much should we learn?
P26,00:34:59,T6,First,Offline,Yeah
P25,00:35:00,T6,First,Offline,That much like I always talks about what you have to do that never talks about what we learn. Anything else before we go to the last one? What is Your personal passion about this project will this mean to you when you succeed?
P27,00:35:22,T6,First,Offline,It something new for me.
P26,00:35:25,T6,First,Offline,But I also like being closer to Harbor. So the second one yessiree. This is why I like it. I also like learning new things rather than just hitting something you've done before that's me.
P25,00:35:49,T6,First,Offline,"Anything else before we leave. Alright, cool"
P21,00:00:07,T5,First,Offline,Shall I do the questions then?
P22,00:00:48,T5,First,Offline,Which project did we pick?
P23,00:00:48,T5,First,Offline,"The one that it says external relationship, the sensor one and  the OCR with the invoices."
P21,00:00:59,T5,First,Offline,Well. It seems that those physical training
P23,00:01:08,T5,First,Offline,On it says for your eyes only and one that says craft Prospect.
P21,00:01:16,T5,First,Offline,Okay
P21,00:02:24,T5,First,Offline,"So let's start with satellite one, do remember it?"
P22,00:02:33,T5,First,Offline,Yep. I remember.
P21,00:02:33,T5,First,Offline,It was like you need to use machine learning and neural networks to create a simulation and something like this.
P22,00:02:41,T5,First,Offline,The trajectory of these satellite diagrams.
P21,00:02:46,T5,First,Offline,Was is the game part of it?
P22,00:02:50,T5,First,Offline,I forget show us taking part of this. I just knew to kind of trace the path that the satellites going to take using machine learning or something like that.
P21,00:02:58,T5,First,Offline,"Okay, so wouldn't the objectives and how do you define success? Okay, so we'll just use like if we could make like a reliable simulation and success is if the if works."
P22,00:03:18,T5,First,Offline,The client is actually like it and if they are going to be deployed for themselves with our names in the credits.
P21,00:03:29,T5,First,Offline,If the product doesn't succeed. What are the implications?
P22,00:03:35,T5,First,Offline,We tried the implication is that we tried.
P21,00:03:42,T5,First,Offline,"Yeah, I mean it's not like anything is going to crush or going to kill somebody."
P23,00:03:51,T5,First,Offline,If it comes back down towards maybe.
P20,00:03:55,T5,First,Offline,It's just a game
P22,00:03:55,T5,First,Offline,Is a game bro.
P21,00:03:57,T5,First,Offline,Why is burning so important? What is the case for change?
P22,00:04:04,T5,First,Offline,I don't think we get to experience you don't machine learning and stuff.
P21,00:04:14,T5,First,Offline,"And from the business point of view, I know how the world of satellites."
P22,00:04:20,T5,First,Offline,Yeah.
P21,00:04:20,T5,First,Offline,But like changing the point of view investors in relation to our game is a game changer.
P22,00:04:28,T5,First,Offline,If they get to see it.
P23,00:04:32,T5,First,Offline,Yeah.
P22,00:04:37,T5,First,Offline,There are key milestones.
P21,00:04:39,T5,First,Offline,For learning machine learning it's.
P22,00:04:43,T5,First,Offline,Yeah actually learning what we need tools that we need.
P20,00:04:50,T5,First,Offline,Yeah.
P21,00:04:50,T5,First,Offline,Understanding ground of Errors.
P22,00:04:54,T5,First,Offline,Yeah.
P21,00:04:58,T5,First,Offline,First like the algorithmic I guess and then like I should we make a game would that be being 3D or 2D?
P22,00:05:10,T5,First,Offline,3D.
P23,00:05:11,T5,First,Offline,Supposed to be like real world. So it has to be 3D.
P21,00:05:14,T5,First,Offline,Yeah each Dimension is fine. What are the most important decisions that need to be made? What would prevent us from making those decisions?
P20,00:05:30,T5,First,Offline,It's hard to judge.
P22,00:05:33,T5,First,Offline,"Yeah, I mean what decision do we have? We have to make a simulation and an arcade game."
P20,00:05:38,T5,First,Offline,Yeah.
P22,00:05:38,T5,First,Offline,It's a like which tools were going to use which environment which developing to are we going to use which is which one seems suitable.
P21,00:05:49,T5,First,Offline,The speed of work and stuff like that.
P22,00:06:00,T5,First,Offline,What are the biggest obstacles to getting this done?
P21,00:06:09,T5,First,Offline,We don't have much experience.
P22,00:06:10,T5,First,Offline,Yeah.
P21,00:06:12,T5,First,Offline,It should be against making them. I mean it sounds like a pretty complex stuff because you rather understand a bit of astronomy and mathematics of satellite stuff like that.
P22,00:06:26,T5,First,Offline,The kind of reporting mathematical part of it.
P21,00:06:30,T5,First,Offline,Yeah. So there's lots of things to take into consideration for me. Who are the key stakeholders? Who's the owner/sponsor? Who influences but doesn't own? Who has the potential to be an obstacle?
P21,00:06:51,T5,First,Offline,"It really goes with the project. Now, Sam is a Glasgow based company?"
P22,00:06:53,T5,First,Offline,Yes
P21,00:07:16,T5,First,Offline,It's probably like other companies that are going to be relying on them.
P21,00:07:30,T5,First,Offline,"Yeah, we are going need for their own stuff."
P22,00:07:40,T5,First,Offline,"Or it might be the department of astronomy or something like that,."
P21,00:07:47,T5,First,Offline,Maybe maybe they're like tight or something like that.
P22,00:07:52,T5,First,Offline,Maybe they have like their owners of group or organisation
P21,00:08:01,T5,First,Offline,What are the projects greatest assets but this is the potential in terms like us learning something to this. Because it goes through both machine learning and then also would probably have to do it like web-based in browser or something like this.
P22,00:08:26,T5,First,Offline,"I guess I mean, how would you define assets in this case?"
P21,00:08:39,T5,First,Offline,The thing that's like advantages.
P21,00:08:50,T5,First,Offline,What are the most important areas we should always focus on#?
P22,00:08:58,T5,First,Offline,"Working together with operating a I would say fresh and control is very important because in one computer it's not just pair programming, like Pentagon Pentagon programmingor so."
P20,00:09:17,T5,First,Offline,Yeah.
P22,00:09:18,T5,First,Offline,Five people in one computer like one will be coding in the fault the other four were judging.
P21,00:09:23,T5,First,Offline,One for the mouse one for right people.
P23,00:09:27,T5,First,Offline,Another person looks at the screen.
P22,00:09:33,T5,First,Offline,"We always have to communicate what he's seeing verbally somehow. Yeah, I can see that working for sure."
P21,00:09:49,T5,First,Offline,I think also it's a little bit difficult to focus on I mean like a manageable plan. I couldn't with a coach knows much about machine learning because he was more into like content stuff. You don't know much about machine learning. So it's a bit difficult to plan about something that we have to first learn like something.
P22,00:10:24,T5,First,Offline,"I mean, I feel like this one is only going to use like basic machine learning, I guess."
P20,00:11:08,T5,First,Offline,So how would you apply neural networks?
P21,00:11:13,T5,First,Offline,From what I understand you have a lot of like matrices basically and they are just because functions they get calculated. It is a thing that I don't know much about it.
P23,00:11:33,T5,First,Offline,Yeah.
P21,00:11:33,T5,First,Offline,So I don't know how much time it takes to actually Implement a neural network based and just know like this absolutely the basic level.
P19,00:11:44,T5,First,Offline,Well I think of this as an out of scope to kind of like change the scope I guess. It can be relatively simple like or really complicated.
P21,00:11:57,T5,First,Offline,I saw those games like these are AI implemented to play the game your spaceship with the new algorithm hopefully avoiding. So we can use this for like satellite loops at the surrounding with this trajectory or something like this.
P20,00:12:29,T5,First,Offline,That one seems to be really interesting to me.
P21,00:12:39,T5,First,Offline,"Okay, how can we best leverage those assets?"
P23,00:12:44,T5,First,Offline,I think we're in number 11. We already said what are the most important areas we should focus on.
P21,00:12:49,T5,First,Offline,Oh Okay. How much risk are we willing to take to accomplish this?
P20,00:12:57,T5,First,Offline,And put my life on the line.
P19,00:13:00,T5,First,Offline,You can launch me in the satellite control of by the.
P22,00:13:08,T5,First,Offline,I can image like you have been launched by the satellite and you're sitting on there like trying to adjust the neural networks.
P19,00:13:32,T5,First,Offline,What risks could possibly be? Like I guess I guess if we'd like trying to overreach or something the risk would be trying to do something too difficult and not being able to dealing with it.
P21,00:13:41,T5,First,Offline,Because with this machine learning stuff it's going to be a danger then it's gonna be clearly feasible to figure.
P19,00:14:01,T5,First,Offline,"Back to ten, I would say we would also have to maintain a good relationship with our clients."
P21,00:14:17,T5,First,Offline,Because.
P22,00:14:19,T5,First,Offline,That's a proper communications.
P21,00:14:19,T5,First,Offline,It sounds like it's like it's viable for them this project and the maybe you just alters the costs is cheaper when they do they by students and in the end like we factor it to make it reusable.
P19,00:14:38,T5,First,Offline,"Well, there are two groups of students. At least if they're angry. They're like it's still going to be divided by two."
P21,00:14:53,T5,First,Offline,Is it about all 50 can do one project in the end just like.
P22,00:14:57,T5,First,Offline,I'm pretty sure they're going to split a little bit.
P21,00:15:00,T5,First,Offline,"So in that case, we might end up being late."
P19,00:15:09,T5,First,Offline,I don't think we can like I don't think until like people can't like pick project now.
P21,00:15:16,T5,First,Offline,"Yeah, the things you're looking on 17 like the first like go and speak with everybody then."
P20,00:15:23,T5,First,Offline,I think you just have to kind of say what are your favorite things maybe like three or five list and then he what will calculate the time.
P19,00:15:32,T5,First,Offline,"Yeah, I think it doesn't seem like it's not like a first-come first-serve thing. Which if it was we can actually take advantage of that because we."
P20,00:15:39,T5,First,Offline,Yeah.
P19,00:15:39,T5,First,Offline,Say all thing's we go straight to.
P20,00:15:41,T5,First,Offline,We just snipe the projects that we like.
P23,00:15:43,T5,First,Offline,Hasn't everyone's seen all these projects?
P21,00:15:49,T5,First,Offline,No no
P19,00:15:49,T5,First,Offline,Just the people who are doing this.
P22,00:15:53,T5,First,Offline,There are 50 groups I would say roughly about 20 percent of the groups would have seen projects.
P20,00:15:58,T5,First,Offline,"Okay, what barriers have you encountered in the past about this issue ?"
P22,00:16:08,T5,First,Offline,This issue was interested in the past.
P19,00:16:10,T5,First,Offline,What issues is it?
P22,00:16:12,T5,First,Offline,"I mean, yeah quite issues actually."
P23,00:16:14,T5,First,Offline,Having the satellite not crash like the that data fundamentals exercise.
P21,00:16:24,T5,First,Offline,What keep you up at night?
P19,00:16:37,T5,First,Offline,What keeps me up at night about satellite?
P20,00:16:49,T5,First,Offline,Yeah.
P19,00:16:50,T5,First,Offline,"I mean, I like the space of it keep you up at night ."
P21,00:16:54,T5,First,Offline,The relation is like we are going to put a team file like in github or something.
P19,00:16:56,T5,First,Offline,What keeps me up is like star watching trying to like see this satellite if  you like exactly what place you can see them passing by so then you're staying up late at night to watch some.
P21,00:17:11,T5,First,Offline,What topics haven't we discussed? What topics would you rather not discuss?
P19,00:17:19,T5,First,Offline,"No, I don't think politics around discuss that."
P20,00:17:26,T5,First,Offline,"What if what if we break something of some of the rules of the country, but if we do something illegal stuff."
P19,00:17:37,T5,First,Offline,I would say we don't do any illegal stuff. Maybe that's controversial. Not sure how you could do something illegal making a game may be the case in the UK. It's definitely possible.
P20,00:18:00,T5,First,Offline,Certainly someone might get offended somehow.
P21,00:18:07,T5,First,Offline,What is your personal passion about this project? What will this mean you when you succeed?
P19,00:18:13,T5,First,Offline,Good grade.
P21,00:18:36,T5,First,Offline,External relations submission for a little freedom to think things through
P23,00:18:52,T5,First,Offline,Is the one with expanding with the enrolment chat bot?
P21,00:18:58,T5,First,Offline,There is a chat bot?
P23,00:18:58,T5,First,Offline,Yeah.
P21,00:18:59,T5,First,Offline,Okay. Cool.
P20,00:19:03,T5,First,Offline,What was that again?
P21,00:19:03,T5,First,Offline,"It was a chat bot about admission. So if you want to apply to U of G and have some questions, you don't bother any of the staff you just write to the chat bot."
P20,00:19:14,T5,First,Offline,Okay.
P22,00:19:15,T5,First,Offline,Any body is taking text as data?
P20,00:19:15,T5,First,Offline,Is it like machine learning
P22,00:19:48,T5,First,Offline,No that one like theoretical course actually learning about the theory behind machine learning but this one is just using machine learning algorithms to process text words.
P20,00:20:01,T5,First,Offline,"I did a little preview, of course because you could do it under General level 3 information. They they involve something like extracting us of data from Twitter using a few hashtags and stuff."
P21,00:20:22,T5,First,Offline,So that what are the objectives? How do we find success?
P21,00:20:28,T5,First,Offline,Objectives is to build the chat bot and success with the gonna use it or something.
P19,00:20:32,T5,First,Offline,I guess we have a couple of things that we wanted specifically to be able to happen.
P21,00:20:39,T5,First,Offline,Yeah.
P19,00:20:43,T5,First,Offline,Baby basic questions about which courses are like what the requirements are.
P21,00:20:52,T5,First,Offline,If the project doesn't succeed what are the implication? Our time being wasted.
P19,00:21:03,T5,First,Offline,Yeah university has to not have a chat bot. I guess. It is that more students have to suffer through my campus.
P21,00:21:20,T5,First,Offline,Why this project is Important? What is the case for change?
P20,00:21:23,T5,First,Offline,For the potential happiness of future students.
P21,00:21:27,T5,First,Offline,I don't know if this is really improve your feelings about it. Just like saving money because you don't have to be stuff.
P19,00:21:37,T5,First,Offline,To be honest. I think it's kind of like You know like stick and sticky tape over like a leak instead of just like fixing natural. The problem is that let my campus is horrible to use.
P21,00:21:49,T5,First,Offline,I know. I think this is this is it because you don't always use my campus for is for the 50 students.
P19,00:22:00,T5,First,Offline,"Oh, okay. Then yeah, I guess just use University one anyway."
P22,00:22:10,T5,First,Offline,What are the key milestones? What the most important dates?
P21,00:22:16,T5,First,Offline,"These is early stages, I guess"
P19,00:22:17,T5,First,Offline,It's like three of them.
P21,00:22:23,T5,First,Offline,I think four.
P19,00:22:27,T5,First,Offline,"Oh, yeah, there's like three the preliminary ones and then like a fourth like final one. Something something like that. I know at least we have to really the first one is a pretty earliest act like it's like in."
P22,00:22:39,T5,First,Offline,November or something like that.
P21,00:22:41,T5,First,Offline,It's gonna be madness. Key milestones though.
P19,00:22:52,T5,First,Offline,Once It's able to understand the first question.
P20,00:22:57,T5,First,Offline,Yes.
P19,00:22:59,T5,First,Offline,It said what it says its first words.
P20,00:23:02,T5,First,Offline,Yeah.
P21,00:23:12,T5,First,Offline,What are the most important decisions that need to be made? What will prevent us from making those decisions decisions?
P19,00:23:20,T5,First,Offline,So I guess.
P21,00:23:21,T5,First,Offline,I think name like Siri and other.
P19,00:23:27,T5,First,Offline,"Yeah, I mean the university might rename it if they actually use it."
P20,00:23:31,T5,First,Offline,They want to make it an appropriate.
P19,00:23:33,T5,First,Offline,Yeah if we name it something very stupid they're not gonna like we don't want to use that. but if we actually I guess we pick like a sensible name than I actually use it.
P20,00:23:42,T5,First,Offline,Like boiler bot.
P19,00:23:45,T5,First,Offline,Done. The scope of that I guess is exactly what like more responds.
P21,00:24:00,T5,First,Offline,"Yeah, also like the way we're going to implement it. Know what sort of questions to include."
P20,00:24:08,T5,First,Offline,So it's going to be one of the bigger obstacles. I feel like.
P22,00:24:20,T5,First,Offline,Maybe also like It's just natural language processing that we need to add I know Alexa for example write so well.
P21,00:24:29,T5,First,Offline,It's not gonna be the spoken language. But with the pipeline. We can do it in machine learning so we can teach him answers to the questions.
P19,00:25:05,T5,First,Offline,Probably doesn't necessarily have to do machine learning which is probably a good way of going back.
P20,00:25:13,T5,First,Offline,Yeah.
P19,00:25:24,T5,First,Offline,Biggest obstacles we are on that one.
P21,00:25:33,T5,First,Offline,"Okay, let's go the seventh. Who are the key stakeholders? Who's the owner/sponsor? Who influences but doesn't own? Who has the potential to be an obstacle? I think our customers they should be an obstacle link the prospective students when they will not be able to ask questions."
P19,00:25:53,T5,First,Offline,Well I by the time later it's actually like being used where like already like wash our hands of it. It'll be after it. So be like just the University. Actually who owns the software when we are done? Probably the University I guess.
P20,00:26:07,T5,First,Offline,Probably the university and maybe us as well?
P23,00:26:11,T5,First,Offline,No
P20,00:26:11,T5,First,Offline,We can actually own it
P19,00:26:11,T5,First,Offline,I think there was a couple they were saying when you're done you actually own the software which I think is pretty cool.
P21,00:26:20,T5,First,Offline,"No, you know like the web app, for example those are made to be university property"
P20,00:26:28,T5,First,Offline,We kind of call it isn't it week. Someone said we have to kind of negotiate with them.
P21,00:26:33,T5,First,Offline,I think the university license says that exclusively
P21,00:26:46,T5,First,Offline,So I think It actually good that the university is that like responsible for it so I mean it would be easy for us to get information the contact them and just harassing their office.
P19,00:27:01,T5,First,Offline,"Yeah, when we respond."
P21,00:27:03,T5,First,Offline,"On the other hand, we want to get like professional links or something. That's might be best for Network. I'll just be honest all the other companies are closed. What are the projects greatest assets?"
P22,00:27:27,T5,First,Offline,"Get it, right and I guess it could be used which would be quite amazing to just kind of say that in a CV as well. And also just feel good."
P19,00:27:40,T5,First,Offline,Yeah.
P22,00:27:40,T5,First,Offline,We're supposed to be over like.
P19,00:27:41,T5,First,Offline,A sense of accomplishment.
P21,00:27:43,T5,First,Offline,Troubles are pretty holes as well.
P19,00:27:46,T5,First,Offline,Especially the smart once.
P22,00:27:48,T5,First,Offline,If we managed to get this done done with learned quite a lot about natural language processing.
P21,00:27:56,T5,First,Offline,Yeah. Also if we are not good on that than it's to be like quite easy to deploy it just with some hard coded questions.
P20,00:28:06,T5,First,Offline,Yeah.
P21,00:28:07,T5,First,Offline,The promotion for language process. How can we best leverage those assets?
P19,00:28:22,T5,First,Offline,I guess another artists kind of mentioned already is that it's the University's so we're like. But we have more access to the customer like.
P21,00:28:33,T5,First,Offline,Yeah.
P19,00:28:33,T5,First,Offline,Like we need to we can we like can find out like the office of federal work is that camp outside there.
P20,00:28:40,T5,First,Offline,Maybe we also get to learn more about people like you. They're trying to go get they're gonna try to chat to our system and we get to learn a thing or two from from them from the way they speak or text.
P21,00:29:00,T5,First,Offline,What are the most important areas we should always focus on?  Language progressing
P20,00:29:16,T5,First,Offline,Yeah. Time management also
P21,00:29:21,T5,First,Offline,How much risks are you willing to take to accomplish this?
P19,00:29:32,T5,First,Offline,I still don't understand that question.
P20,00:29:34,T5,First,Offline,Our credits are online. We have to try very hard please
P21,00:29:41,T5,First,Offline,30 credits is pretty serious.
P19,00:29:43,T5,First,Offline,Yeah.
P21,00:29:51,T5,First,Offline,What barriers can be encountered in the past about this issue?
P20,00:29:57,T5,First,Offline,I think that's really a good question. Actually we can skip this one.
P22,00:30:01,T5,First,Offline,I worked on like hackathon never barriers like but this first year so.
P21,00:30:09,T5,First,Offline,"So, how'd it go at the end?"
P22,00:30:10,T5,First,Offline,"Well, we managed to do it. We actually read it to men like uses could say, okay, like read the this subreddit like the top use and then it also goes to the comments. So that was it but just in couple of days basically. So, but I just remember it was being a bit frustrating because you always have this game. Alexa voice, you know with the feedback is always wrong and it's just like changing but the in the end with it did quite well we were working on those variants."
P19,00:30:50,T5,First,Offline,Was the frustrating part the like voice recognition or like okay.
P22,00:30:55,T5,First,Offline,That's always on the voice recognition. The only thing you need to do is just the way it's all in Json like these are high at the kind of moving between instance this two years ago. And then also you could write it either in python or Java just hang it up and it wasn't just so straight forward like the actual development process because you have to work within this framework. So you have to first learn this framework whether we use this Alexa to or Google also has one that will maybe the the first big task and then once we are kind of comfortable with it and should school with smoothly.
P21,00:31:49,T5,First,Offline,Do you want to go the next?
P19,00:31:50,T5,First,Offline,It becomes aggressive to the users.
P21,00:32:01,T5,First,Offline,Singularity as well.
P20,00:32:10,T5,First,Offline,"By the way, we don't have much time left because the guys going to leave around and."
P21,00:32:16,T5,First,Offline,"Okay, one what one last project. Was it this one? System integration to it? We could have a cloud-based product management tool to use and manage medicines and time spent and customers projects the development team. Anyone know this one? It is different clouds based Alm tool to manage user stories task box, especially in your of the project management tool with task. It will allow the users to load the PDF file presented on the screen and identify areas of the document that map to real data to assist this map and present subsequent PDF file to extract the data is configured in the generated XML Json file. Upon successful completion, will built a mobile web app that lets you take pictures of invoice and import them. We also investigate support from other manufacturers. So it's like you get PDF file and it's all see analyse PDF and like makes it original bit. Because PDF file in the end is like jpg or because."
P19,00:33:35,T5,First,Offline,It depends doesn't it? Sometimes the text.
P21,00:33:37,T5,First,Offline,But you I think Adobe lets do that.
P19,00:33:46,T5,First,Offline,"Well, it depends with some PDFs like the text is just part of like the image and sometimes it is actually text that you in theory can edit or abused. So I'm not sure if it would require is that requires us to be able to like basically recognise text from an image and then parse it or just we can just add the  plain text."
P21,00:34:08,T5,First,Offline,"You can copy the text from PDF, but you would lose the structure. I don't remember us talking about the project before."
P19,00:34:19,T5,First,Offline,I don't know.
P22,00:34:20,T5,First,Offline,I just mentioned that there's an OCR makes a Json out of PDF I had this before.
P21,00:34:36,T5,First,Offline,Should we go to the next one?
P22,00:34:36,T5,First,Offline,"I don't know, image recognition sounds a bit more."
P21,00:34:46,T5,First,Offline,"I actually it was in the sense that libraries for us that let's you take the image recognition. That quite good actually. So you're the dash makes Json, so rename it and stuff like that, but it's like they were every image. The the the Json has different so you need to do some machine learning or something that they recognise was it Heather, stuff like that."
P20,00:35:14,T5,First,Offline,But I'm pretty familiar with this one's so it's good for some people. Sen..
P20,00:35:27,T5,First,Offline,Sensors
P21,00:35:20,T5,First,Offline,That's the hardware that the cameras that you to develop like a software for them to display in a demo Xbox and stuff.
P20,00:35:43,T5,First,Offline,Are we still good?
P21,00:36:20,T5,First,Offline,"Also, this one I think it's called obashi or stuff like that."
P20,00:36:28,T5,First,Offline,Obashi would be an honour.
P21,00:36:28,T5,First,Offline,"Seriously guys, we have been to a computer science conference and there was a speaker form that company. So this is cool because I think is the purest application of machine learning because basically into you also have like files and you need to understand them. So it's sort of like the the one with OCR and then also develop a web to mobile app to encrypt them and decrypt them having only the key from your mobile app. I mean it sounds very complicated but on the other it's a big company so we may be cool to work with them and what's covers quite a terrific task. The things for example with a satellite does there is there is no existing projects about machine learning satellites here because we're would like an analysing PDFs. I think there are plenty of them. So it can both learn and also like having guide that will walk us through it."
P19,00:37:53,T5,First,Offline,"Yes, I mean like yeah, it's supposed to I think like They're not being president is like a benefit if it makes sense. Like it's cool of like do something. It's kind of new but it does make it a little bit harder."
P21,00:38:10,T5,First,Offline,Yeah.
P20,00:38:11,T5,First,Offline,Also means that if you're doing something like we're doing like analysing a PDF like the bars a little bit higher because like it's been done before.
P21,00:38:19,T5,First,Offline,Well. I don't  actually if you are going to be partial mouse .
P19,00:38:24,T5,First,Offline,I have no idea. They do base the difficulty of the project like they do take that in to account.
P21,00:38:29,T5,First,Offline,You know.
P19,00:38:30,T5,First,Offline,But probably don't composite fully though.
P21,00:38:32,T5,First,Offline,Yeah. I know machine learning will be still machine learning. I don't think anybody like all the other projects we have here have sort of the same difficulty in the sense of like the judges in your eyes but for us some with that little easier and some harder and like going for the hardest one doesn't exclude me with that we can learn almost so.
P19,00:39:00,T5,First,Offline,"Well, first satellite one basically you have to have like a physics simulation."
P21,00:39:06,T5,First,Offline,Yes.
P19,00:39:06,T5,First,Offline,Essentially and then applying machine learning to it.
P21,00:39:10,T5,First,Offline,And then also building the front of the display of the database.
P19,00:39:21,T5,First,Offline,I mean it's going to be pretty simple.
P22,00:39:24,T5,First,Offline,"As long as we don't have like a big obstacle that takes a lot of time to actually get our head around then, I think anything is fine. It's just that's the only thing that I'm slightly worried about in case there is something that you know, like actually would take maybe like half semester, you know to properly use it. But if it's not like that with that I agree with the libraries and we just have to kind of play around to understand one thing."
P21,00:39:54,T5,First,Offline,It wasn't just like because we go this weekend to the pickathon and just gonna be like one machine learning tasks and have a look at this.
P22,00:40:18,T5,First,Offline,"There's always a natural language processing task as well lifestyles of JPMorgan detecting fake news. No we can also. Smart integrate, have we tasked about it."
P20,00:40:32,T5,First,Offline,"Smarts route. No, we couldn't those are some very cool actually."
P22,00:40:39,T5,First,Offline,What is it? I have a friend who works and understands. I mean if it's like play sending electricity actually like making software for the for the plans.
P21,00:40:52,T5,First,Offline,And installations very complex situation because basically it does the department how much energy they need to create generate biochemically machine learning during that does that called the plate.
P19,00:41:09,T5,First,Offline,I think with that one particular isn't it? Based on the weather report? How much told generated from wind turbines and solar panels?
P21,00:41:17,T5,First,Offline,"Yeah, maybe I think actually."
P19,00:41:19,T5,First,Offline,I think that I have memorised.
P21,00:41:21,T5,First,Offline,Just one variable in there.
P19,00:41:23,T5,First,Offline,"But weather I guess can be multiple areas like wind, speed, temperature also New Zealand or UK."
P21,00:41:32,T5,First,Offline,"I guess price be with me we can use easy to get like the weather reports feels like if he does the like power consumption data or stuff like that, prof if we calculate it. I think the best thing is to actually go on this because it is not first come first serve and once we have a cover which is gonna talk with the customers."
P19,00:41:59,T5,First,Offline,Yeah.
P21,00:42:00,T5,First,Offline,We're gonna find out how to do it and they're like who people to work with?
P20,00:42:12,T5,First,Offline,I think we should finish our meeting.
P21,00:43:21,T5,First,Offline,Okay. No we can thing about we keeps us up at night.
P13,00:00:05,T3,First,Offline,"Alright, okay. Evidence-based nutritional support help immediately. I am turned off from this. Yeah, pressing need to develop low-cost interventions to improve knowledge surrounding good nutrition. This sounds like it will take a lot of time and there will be a lot of demands."
P11,00:00:31,T3,First,Offline,I'm just going to read that first because you get better you before.
P12,00:00:35,T3,First,Offline,It's probably the best idea. So you're getting the recorded
P11,00:01:55,T3,First,Offline,"Each page has a different project, right?"
P12,00:02:03,T3,First,Offline,Yeah
P10,00:02:03,T3,First,Offline,Yes
P11,00:02:08,T3,First,Offline,Some of them don't get very much.
P13,00:02:24,T3,First,Offline,Hmm
P11,00:02:44,T3,First,Offline,"This one, the University is recently commissioned IT management software from Avanti and we would be interested in knowing if this software might be able to be used if you bought it like, hopefully."
P13,00:02:58,T3,First,Offline,The uni ones are always a good laugh. Apparently.
P11,00:03:02,T3,First,Offline,Yeah.
P13,00:03:06,T3,First,Offline,"Also, you want to avoid health care wherever possible."
P11,00:03:10,T3,First,Offline,Really! I thought they like.
P13,00:03:13,T3,First,Offline,Specifically NHS. It's just.
P11,00:03:16,T3,First,Offline,This one's kind of it healthcare but it seems decent Instead of incomes
P10,00:03:40,T3,First,Offline,This one is for Space Engineering.
P12,00:03:42,T3,First,Offline,It sounds pretty cool.
P13,00:03:44,T3,First,Offline,That's that's that's one is also really good. It's basically machine learning to figure out what power like the power generators output might be in real terms and then.
P11,00:03:58,T3,First,Offline,Only issues we don't do ML into like next year.
P13,00:04:02,T3,First,Offline,"ML is really easy and then build a rest interface for it. Like, I don't know if it's already yeah rest is fine easy. And it's all but whether data is well, it's basically just there's this sounds really easy. T"
P12,00:04:21,T3,First,Offline,hat sounds good to us like personal information. But to be kept it is like on a phone and you point the phone on a paper and it decrypts it on to the paper.
P13,00:04:31,T3,First,Offline,Oh.
P11,00:04:32,T3,First,Offline,How it has to decrypt it into a paper?
P12,00:04:32,T3,First,Offline,It got like
P13,00:04:47,T3,First,Offline,The visualization
P12,00:04:47,T3,First,Offline,oh like the AR
P12,00:04:47,T3,First,Offline,I did an encrypted messaging app for my first second year and she's oh my god when it comes to encryption if we were writing the encryption it's really difficult.
P12,00:04:59,T3,First,Offline,Really?
P11,00:04:59,T3,First,Offline,That will make sense
P13,00:04:59,T3,First,Offline,To get right and get working. Yeah. It's really really difficult. We had to decided so that's really interesting.
P10,00:05:09,T3,First,Offline,This one is kind of easy as just like you have a dashboard and you just have to show the things that like that user is looking at most like using artificial intelligence. I mean we didn't do it but it seems easy because you just have to show what.
P13,00:05:26,T3,First,Offline,"Machine learning. Yeah, basically anything to do with machine learning is always kind of easy."
P10,00:05:32,T3,First,Offline,"I mean Yeah. I don't know how it works, but it shouldn't be too difficult."
P13,00:05:43,T3,First,Offline,Oh no oh no instantly it's talking about Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and that is on big red flag. It's like the Wi-Fi spec is not fun to work with.
P12,00:05:58,T3,First,Offline,This is something with Health Care much cannot beat that.
P13,00:06:02,T3,First,Offline,Yeah. The thing about health care is that you needed to be reliable. It needs to have a ton of tests associated with it and also needs to service like thousands of users. It's usually more difficult than
P12,00:06:27,T3,First,Offline,Are we supposed to be looking through these questions? No?
P13,00:06:29,T3,First,Offline,I'm going to look at them after I've read these.
P11,00:06:36,T3,First,Offline,This one is literally asking for us to make a product. Like I don't that would be Engineering in addition to computer science in addition to robotics. I don't know what.
P12,00:06:47,T3,First,Offline,Oh really?
P13,00:06:47,T3,First,Offline,Yeah. Okay. It's like they can fucked.
P12,00:06:51,T3,First,Offline,"Sorry, the language."
P13,00:06:51,T3,First,Offline,I'm speaking as I would.
P12,00:06:51,T3,First,Offline,Fair enough
P13,00:06:58,T3,First,Offline,I think I think that's the point of this is to like see how people like.
P12,00:07:01,T3,First,Offline,It it how it is different from online speaking I spouse.
P11,00:07:02,T3,First,Offline,Yeah.
P13,00:07:03,T3,First,Offline,Yeah I'm just as bad on online.
P11,00:07:03,T3,First,Offline,Consistent
P13,00:07:03,T3,First,Offline,"This one dose not sound fun. Everyone wants a rest API. There's also this one which is about basically making Adobe Premiere but with like annotations for scripts, but it sounds like ingesting a bunch of data of video data and audio data included even time stamping it to correspond with Shakespeare's texts, but now the text."
P11,00:07:41,T3,First,Offline,Would that involve like speech like semantics
P13,00:07:46,T3,First,Offline,"The text being available makes it much more easier than before but they want to generalize it. So like case stuff and all sorts of nutritional app, absolutely not Yeah, that's the smaller grids. That steam is good. Not only not the way that the suede are even though."
P10,00:08:08,T3,First,Offline,They are organised.
P13,00:08:09,T3,First,Offline,Even if it's kind of like flamboyant and over-the-top like for What is.
P11,00:08:14,T3,First,Offline,At latest Organized.
P10,00:08:15,T3,First,Offline,"I mean, that means that there is one person that is like in charge of."
P13,00:08:20,T3,First,Offline,Not only that they have got contact details.
P10,00:08:21,T3,First,Offline,"I mean look at this one, it's txt file."
P11,00:08:26,T3,First,Offline,Yeah.
P13,00:08:26,T3,First,Offline,Not only that this has a document number it has an email address already there like you have a name.
P10,00:08:39,T3,First,Offline,"Because he was he said I also have a third project, but I'm not sure."
P11,00:08:58,T3,First,Offline,Will we compare someone who is always demanding or compare with someone who don't give a fuck about what we handle in the end.
P13,00:09:00,T3,First,Offline,I think the think the best the best one is one that you can like coordinate with whoever is right and in a manner that is helpful because ultimately it's not about just the finished product and just handing in whatever it's about the process. You got to get there.
P11,00:09:20,T3,First,Offline,Someone has read the burning down Cathedrals and building whatever.
P13,00:09:25,T3,First,Offline,I completely agree if that guys take he's so right I looked Cathedral. It's really good book.
P11,00:09:34,T3,First,Offline,It was nice
P12,00:09:34,T3,First,Offline,I didn't read that.
P13,00:09:37,T3,First,Offline,"Well, this is interesting is so soft with a typo. All right. Physics and astronomy."
P11,00:09:45,T3,First,Offline,Astronomy is like quite story-ish. So it's not a hard to read.
P12,00:09:50,T3,First,Offline,Oh really?
P13,00:09:51,T3,First,Offline,So that's guys actually look like a grad student who is just looking for a.
P11,00:09:54,T3,First,Offline,He is.  Waite is it the one that was the start up?
P13,00:09:58,T3,First,Offline,Particle physics group working at CERN Large Hadron Collider.
P11,00:10:04,T3,First,Offline,Working at CERN?
P13,00:10:06,T3,First,Offline,"Yes, this involves sensitive Electronics."
P10,00:10:09,T3,First,Offline,It's about like about multi pixel detector of radiation. And then we have to do a bunch of things that I didn't understand. So I'm just.
P12,00:10:21,T3,First,Offline,Yeah but it seems like a lot of science.
P10,00:10:27,T3,First,Offline,Like they have bullet points. They're helpful .
P13,00:10:38,T3,First,Offline,"I don't like this one. That's that's this gives me the fear. This gives me, especially when it says further the information that has been provided to trigger environmental controls. EG heaters dehumidifiers and the whereas when conditions exceeds."
P11,00:10:57,T3,First,Offline,What. okay.
P13,00:10:58,T3,First,Offline,"These are mostly stored on a publicly and remotely accessible server. What no, no do not do this."
P12,00:11:05,T3,First,Offline,No body in life what things of the teams that get happy like fucking shit ones.
P13,00:11:08,T3,First,Offline,"Yeah, it would be like these, like oh my God, that's one of the figure this is this is an accident waiting to happen."
P10,00:11:16,T3,First,Offline,Do all other have to pick their project on the day?
P13,00:11:23,T3,First,Offline,Yes.
P12,00:11:24,T3,First,Offline,Are they?
P13,00:11:24,T3,First,Offline,Yes on the day.
P10,00:11:27,T3,First,Offline,"Well, at least we have time to you know read about everything"
P13,00:11:32,T3,First,Offline,OBASHI for your eyes only. This is very.
P12,00:11:36,T3,First,Offline,Like kind of cool.
P13,00:11:37,T3,First,Offline,Yeah. Yeah.
P12,00:11:38,T3,First,Offline,That's very  interesting.
P13,00:12:16,T3,First,Offline,"I think this is pointless to display all data, but it is cool."
P12,00:12:21,T3,First,Offline,It is cool I.
P10,00:12:24,T3,First,Offline,"This one. If you do it, like, you know, really good week good way to see they may consider to hire someone for the internship. Next summer is like the space thing the space basically like we would have to."
P11,00:12:41,T3,First,Offline,I wonder how Universities sent that out.
P10,00:12:42,T3,First,Offline,I don't know. But like we would have to develop a simulation and visualization tool will like Python and something else.
P11,00:12:58,T3,First,Offline,These two are pretty basic and boring and not very interesting. But I think it also be easier than others. But also not entirely sure what I'm really looking for what I'm going to do so this general impression.
P13,00:13:18,T3,First,Offline,Okay. This is an interesting but also I'm already visualizing hurdles they may come up because of it.
P11,00:13:31,T3,First,Offline,Elaborate
P13,00:13:31,T3,First,Offline,Detecting what is paper and what isn't paper. That's that's a machine learning task that you need like a data set to work on have to begin with think of like the there's a bunch of Do you know much better machine learning?
P11,00:13:44,T3,First,Offline,"I've seen a couple of like talks, but I don't know that much."
P13,00:13:46,T3,First,Offline,So you train computer in machine learning by having the answer sheet to millions of data problems. And the thing is you do need that in order to.
P11,00:13:57,T3,First,Offline,Train the computer.
P13,00:13:59,T3,First,Offline,To drain it and without that kind of data set for paper. That's would be difficult.
P12,00:14:06,T3,First,Offline,Dose it mean any sort of could it be any surface then?
P13,00:14:10,T3,First,Offline,"Yeah, right."
P12,00:14:10,T3,First,Offline,It says paper but surely.
P13,00:14:12,T3,First,Offline,That that's what I be interested in like asking them and finding. What was this the questions?
P12,00:14:27,T3,First,Offline,Key stakeholders.
P11,00:14:27,T3,First,Offline,Why is the project so important? Because it's so good.
P13,00:14:43,T3,First,Offline,"Yeah, okay. So like a bunch of these questions about risks and how much risk. Are you willing to take to accomplish it? I feel like some of these projects always also adjust the standards me at the way to rescue to take one. You're relying on for example, the Shakespeare one you're relying on being able to find to get a responsive UI that can handle interesting video of multiple formats and codecs and audio and text syncing it together and then having the UI to do with that."
P12,00:15:25,T3,First,Offline,Yes.
P13,00:15:25,T3,First,Offline,That's that's something that you would get a team of 20 to work on.
P12,00:15:31,T3,First,Offline,This is quite a good question. What keeps you up at night?
P13,00:15:33,T3,First,Offline,What keeps me up at night.
P12,00:15:35,T3,First,Offline,About his project.
P13,00:15:42,T3,First,Offline,Is there are ones that you say best was one of.
P11,00:15:47,T3,First,Offline,You can look at my reject pile if you want
P13,00:15:53,T3,First,Offline,If you deem it and rejects it I will.
P12,00:15:54,T3,First,Offline,Trust you.
P13,00:15:56,T3,First,Offline,Yeah. Agile CIC what do I know they've got a mean word and the name.
P12,00:16:23,T3,First,Offline,Last last year for this one. They made the map but a the use of third-party server and then the license run out of the server they couldn't contact the team for months.
P13,00:16:35,T3,First,Offline,That's a big red flag boy. Oh poor guys.
P12,00:16:43,T3,First,Offline,I don't know.
P11,00:16:44,T3,First,Offline,What was it for.
P12,00:16:45,T3,First,Offline,I'm not sure. It's to do like a youth charity.
P13,00:16:51,T3,First,Offline,"Okay. So this one Agile CIC identify the problem. So due to regarding people's experiences of physical injury activity often limited by what number of respondents per quality questioning non uniformity across the sector insufficient effective dissemination to other organisations. Okay. Yeah, that's true. We were trying to produce an application where your application is introducing another standards into a see of like or I don't know that sounds kind of kind of productive. Have you seen that XKCD comic or is like this 15 standards here and nothing brings them all together and they're all competing. I know I'll make another standard there are no 16 standards. Okay, it seems like I've kind of situation like everyone wants to be the person that does but they ultimately contribute to the problem. Okay, you are right. This is this is easy so."
P12,00:18:08,T3,First,Offline,To develop software. This is a nice one to develop software to provide feedback on patterns of antimicrobial resistance antimicrobial prescribing advice and antibiotic usage patterns.
P11,00:18:27,T3,First,Offline,Do they give us the data?
P13,00:18:29,T3,First,Offline,That's a good data.
P11,00:18:29,T3,First,Offline,If the data is already there
P13,00:18:29,T3,First,Offline,Yeah. Okay. So that seems to be like a rezoning concern is that if they have the data then.
P12,00:18:43,T3,First,Offline,Yeah.
P11,00:18:43,T3,First,Offline,As long as we don't have to do too much work to get the materials we need.
P13,00:18:47,T3,First,Offline,"Yeah, right, right because beta is part of the ones."
P11,00:18:52,T3,First,Offline,That I highlighted were data.
P13,00:18:54,T3,First,Offline,Yeah.
P10,00:18:55,T3,First,Offline,If they have a clear idea of what they want is way easier.
P11,00:18:58,T3,First,Offline,For sure because we can give actual feedback like this one.
P10,00:19:03,T3,First,Offline,"Like is the one you gave me. It seems nice, but they don't really have a clear idea of what they are. Like, I would like the one about the class."
P13,00:19:15,T3,First,Offline,"Did you see the girl with the Pearl Harbor project her completely broke apart because the client just had no idea what they want it. They kept coming back to the table and being like Oh, no see that thing that you were developing for the last three weeks. We want to completely refactor it and change it."
P10,00:19:36,T3,First,Offline,"See like in this one. They say like they want like polls and quizzes in one app, but I also want chat Bots and also they want."
P11,00:19:45,T3,First,Offline,That will be easy to do
P12,00:19:46,T3,First,Offline,Yeah and they also want like a lecturer to student and a student to student feedback system.
P12,00:19:53,T3,First,Offline,Especially in moodle.
P10,00:19:54,T3,First,Offline,But it's and they say that they have seen these apps like already existing but they want everything together in just one app.
P11,00:20:02,T3,First,Offline,"So wait, do they?"
P10,00:20:02,T3,First,Offline,Yes.
P10,00:20:04,T3,First,Offline,"They want like there are few existing apps that do either of those things but not in one app. Yeah, I mean, it's just."
P13,00:20:13,T3,First,Offline,Makes me nervous.
P11,00:20:15,T3,First,Offline,I get what you're saying about how they don't have a clue.
P10,00:20:18,T3,First,Offline,"Yeah, just maybe like they saw things working. Well another apps and they are like, I want this in my app and then you maybe do it in a different way and they're like, no, I want it like."
P11,00:20:27,T3,First,Offline,"I mean like with this one of these they give three bullet points for like exactly so I'm kind of the only thing I did this summer, you know, the website my problem that like, I didn't finish it in three months is just because every time I saw the like this person with whom I was working she was like, I don't really know just do whatever you want. And then I didn't it was like, yeah but I don't, so, you know,."
P11,00:20:55,T3,First,Offline,This is really good humbler.
P13,00:20:57,T3,First,Offline,Very very straightforward very to the point. Also I'm familiar with angular and doing things like this and angular will be a piece of cake. It's all JavaScript.
P11,00:21:12,T3,First,Offline,I feel like there's gonna be like a steep learning curve in the beginning though.
P10,00:21:15,T3,First,Offline,Because I don't know anything about that but he seems clear as well.
P13,00:21:21,T3,First,Offline,I did physics so I should feel yeah.
P11,00:21:56,T3,First,Offline,I just don't understand what what this one's for it says what they want but doesn't actually say what for.
P13,00:22:04,T3,First,Offline,Yeah.
P11,00:22:04,T3,First,Offline,Like okay you're this but what do you do? I don't.
P13,00:22:09,T3,First,Offline,Have you guys over the smart object one yet ? Okay. So all the information is on the back. The rest of it is just a content. Linux Mac and Raspberry Pi.
P11,00:22:30,T3,First,Offline,It looked a bit messy.
P13,00:22:32,T3,First,Offline,So that should be fine. But also.
P10,00:22:36,T3,First,Offline,How do you do it.
P13,00:22:38,T3,First,Offline,I know how to do that.
P10,00:22:39,T3,First,Offline,I don't know yet
P13,00:22:41,T3,First,Offline,"Yeah, usually use a set of libraries, that's specific to those things and an emulator of some sort llvm is a good set of tools that I should do things."
P10,00:23:13,T3,First,Offline,There are many things involved.
P13,00:23:15,T3,First,Offline,Yes.
P11,00:23:22,T3,First,Offline,I feel this one is good and that they know what they want. It seems like well-structured.
P13,00:23:27,T3,First,Offline,Right.
P11,00:23:27,T3,First,Offline,Again though steep learning curve and trying to figure out exactly how to use what they give us. It's like either to meet the physical constraints of a network to reduce output power generators. I know nothing about that. I've no idea where I'd begin.
P13,00:23:44,T3,First,Offline,"Basically as long as but they have the data that's the thing you know, they've got."
P11,00:23:49,T3,First,Offline,Do they dose it say specifically?
P13,00:23:49,T3,First,Offline,Yeah. I feel like that's interesting.
P13,00:24:06,T3,First,Offline,This immediately red flag the development of external software integration capital T sockets socket connection control The Exchange use different default socket Mmm Yeah.
P11,00:24:21,T3,First,Offline,That's the CERN one.
P13,00:24:22,T3,First,Offline,"Yeah, this is the CERN one."
P11,00:24:24,T3,First,Offline,Can we do like a really quick things that we think are good and trash everything else.
P13,00:24:27,T3,First,Offline,Okay. This is not very good.
P10,00:24:31,T3,First,Offline,"So I don't have much experience, but I'm a quick learner."
P13,00:25:06,T3,First,Offline,I've got enough knowledge to like be able to look at something and say or I can feasibly do this or not.
P11,00:25:41,T3,First,Offline,Why is it so much scarier than carrier sense? Sounds horrible. Can we not do this one? Especially the confidentiality issues.
P13,00:26:02,T3,First,Offline,"Oh, yeah. I know we would be fucked up. That's another reason why you don't do medical is because confidentiality and encryption as much as I want that stuff is just. This is a little vague."
P10,00:26:30,T3,First,Offline,"Yeah, that's what I was thinking. They just say like you have to put things together. This is the space arcade satellite simulation thing."
P13,00:26:42,T3,First,Offline,Jump two.
P12,00:26:52,T3,First,Offline,That another page is basically one to one.
P11,00:26:55,T3,First,Offline,I feel like not many of these people have a good grasp of what we're capable of doing.
P13,00:27:15,T3,First,Offline,"Of course features. Oh, hello."
P12,00:27:19,T3,First,Offline,That one is quite laid out well so basically tells you what they want and whether they need it or not I.
P13,00:27:24,T3,First,Offline,"Okay, so let's start with only if technically feeling. Actually, I think you might be able to do that"
P12,00:27:39,T3,First,Offline,What was it?
P13,00:27:40,T3,First,Offline,A journey plan talk like you needs extensive collapse. Also Google Maps API the restricted.
P11,00:27:49,T3,First,Offline,Yes. I see that.
P13,00:27:50,T3,First,Offline,"Recently constructed it to like twenty thousands queries per year, which is kind like."
P11,00:28:00,T3,First,Offline,You have to pay to like get the full.
P13,00:28:03,T3,First,Offline,"Yeah, you go for 20,000 in like a month if you're if you're even like remotely useful as an application. So yeah. No, I don't think so."
P11,00:28:17,T3,First,Offline,I've not heard of VTK before.
P13,00:28:23,T3,First,Offline,They are those are those are two kits like do you know about GTK or you do you remember TK gate.
P12,00:28:31,T3,First,Offline,Yeah
P12,00:28:31,T3,First,Offline,"Oh, yeah to valid your tasks ."
P13,00:28:33,T3,First,Offline,That written using a visual Library called TK and TK has been extended in many ways. And that's just a few of them and they suck. They suck to work with they suck all.
P11,00:28:50,T3,First,Offline,The other thing I can think of is of two different games created by two different groups. They're going to have completely different coding Styles all kinds of C shit. I don't know if you want to do that.
P12,00:28:59,T3,First,Offline,Yeah.
P10,00:29:00,T3,First,Offline,Is that done like a website?
P13,00:29:00,T3,First,Offline,It's like an app. I'm going off of the idea of doing an app. It just Android apps are just so bad to develop this.
P11,00:29:16,T3,First,Offline,I have done a desktop app not like a web browser app.
P13,00:29:21,T3,First,Offline,Yeah. Yeah. Those aren't too bad because almost a web browser.
P12,00:29:25,T3,First,Offline,Fair enough.
P11,00:29:32,T3,First,Offline,Are you done?
P12,00:29:32,T3,First,Offline,"I, if that's ok."
P10,00:29:32,T3,First,Offline,Yeah Yeah. Don't worry.
P11,00:29:32,T3,First,Offline,We don't you miss your train
P12,00:29:32,T3,First,Offline,I hope you enjoy the rest of it.  Are you guys for long?
P13,00:29:44,T3,First,Offline,I'll stay for the next for the duration really.
P12,00:29:46,T3,First,Offline,No problem. See you next week.
P11,00:29:55,T3,First,Offline,"Oh wait dude  we have the IS quiz tomorrow, by the way."
P13,00:30:00,T3,First,Offline,"No, it's on Tuesday."
P11,00:30:02,T3,First,Offline,No information systems at the end of the lecture tomorrow.
P13,00:30:05,T3,First,Offline,"Oh, I just knew that."
P10,00:30:13,T3,First,Offline,I mean last year with web application we did like
P13,00:30:20,T3,First,Offline,"Also that means that they have experience with students. Actually be operational full compliance of GPR oh no. I'm going to say no based on being an app, but I'm open to other people like changing my mind and that."
P11,00:30:42,T3,First,Offline,Is there any capacity for many groups these can take on? Like I think a new. Can you definitely pick what you want to do or will they already assigned.
P13,00:30:51,T3,First,Offline,"Well, we can pick whatever we want. Okay, at least we're on that position."
P11,00:30:58,T3,First,Offline,For sure.
P13,00:31:00,T3,First,Offline,So.
P12,00:31:00,T3,First,Offline,But do we get to choose before everyone else?
P11,00:31:04,T3,First,Offline,I think the thing is on the same day thing is we can go straight up to the front of the yeah. We won those like before other people viewing finish reading them.
P13,00:31:11,T3,First,Offline,"Okay. So this is easy. In fact, would you mind if I mark these hard. This is easy. This is hard. This seems about."
P11,00:31:28,T3,First,Offline,This one I still don't understand what they want. Like I see their product but I don't know what it's for. I have no idea what kind of here.
P10,00:31:37,T3,First,Offline,Because we don't the name of like the.
P11,00:31:39,T3,First,Offline,It's literally in the text file is created where and that's all the information there is about the actual.
P10,00:31:44,T3,First,Offline,"Waite, but this guy said he had like a couple of projects. So maybe it's like."
P11,00:31:49,T3,First,Offline,"On the other hand, maybe this is just a basic text while the company is too big and important to bother writing compounds."
P13,00:32:00,T3,First,Offline,Okay. So would you like to pull this one out?
P11,00:32:02,T3,First,Offline,I'm able to okay of what we actually we want to do. Is this a no?
P13,00:32:15,T3,First,Offline,"See what you think. See what you think. So this is on it. This is on finesse. All right, this is put this in this position. Yeah, that's this is cool technology constraints for the Standalone service. There are no technological constraints students of reaches like whatever language or framework they choose and I mean if any of you are comfortable with like any kind of."
P11,00:32:47,T3,First,Offline,Don't say assembly.
P10,00:32:49,T3,First,Offline,"Don't say, oh"
P13,00:32:49,T3,First,Offline,A framework.
P13,00:32:50,T3,First,Offline,Okay. Any kind of framework or if you're comfortable with any
P11,00:32:52,T3,First,Offline,"Because if you say assembly, I will walk out of this room"
P13,00:32:52,T3,First,Offline,Basically I want I don't care. I want to learn a new language preferably of this is so I don't.
P11,00:33:10,T3,First,Offline,Really?
P13,00:33:10,T3,First,Offline,Yes.
P11,00:33:10,T3,First,Offline,Entirely new?
P13,00:33:10,T3,First,Offline,"Not entirely new, I'm just shit the JavaScript. I'm shit at most like things like that. So I would like to I would like to be able to like wearing more of it."
P13,00:33:34,T3,First,Offline,"From online and offline sources Okay, I'm not so sure about this one anymore. I'm going to need to reread it again."
P10,00:33:46,T3,First,Offline,Maybe we can see that we can think of it.
P11,00:33:49,T3,First,Offline,Why would these people why would Wilson want an individual user mailbox? I feel like that's an existing thing.
P13,00:33:59,T3,First,Offline,Right
P10,00:34:00,T3,First,Offline,Like direct messages.
P13,00:34:01,T3,First,Offline,Reinventing the wheel.
P11,00:34:05,T3,First,Offline,Also journey planner like what?
P13,00:34:07,T3,First,Offline,"Yeah, the journey planner is about a mess, but then again it's not in like."
P11,00:34:13,T3,First,Offline,It's just redundant.
P13,00:34:18,T3,First,Offline,"Okay. So basically what we've come up with is that none of these projects are particularly good. Yeah, this is very difficult. I have I have a feeling this is."
P11,00:34:31,T3,First,Offline,This is a no from me
P13,00:34:34,T3,First,Offline,It's no from you?
P11,00:34:34,T3,First,Offline,Yes
P13,00:34:34,T3,First,Offline,"Sweet. Okay. Okay. We also call craneware dot text here. You know, I am kind of endeared. I'm kind of endeared my criminal text."
P11,00:34:50,T3,First,Offline,They're doing very well in the stock markets.
P13,00:34:52,T3,First,Offline,Who are are?
P11,00:34:53,T3,First,Offline,Craneware
P13,00:34:53,T3,First,Offline,"They actually? Yeah, seriously."
P11,00:34:57,T3,First,Offline,1.5%.
P13,00:35:00,T3,First,Offline,What's their actual position.
P11,00:35:32,T3,First,Offline,The fucking Healthcare.
P10,00:35:34,T3,First,Offline,Yeah.
P13,00:35:34,T3,First,Offline,You F.
P11,00:35:58,T3,First,Offline,This is interesting and difficult.
P13,00:36:01,T3,First,Offline,"Yeah, right, right very difficult. You see what do I mean."
P11,00:36:06,T3,First,Offline,Maybe completely relying on like third party who agrees to do everything for us .
P13,00:36:10,T3,First,Offline,"Yeah, exactly like and doing your own cryptography always a bad idea. Craneware right. Is very vague"
P11,00:36:24,T3,First,Offline,I don't like if it vague.
P13,00:36:28,T3,First,Offline,But it feels like they've just got a bunch of data and they just want us to start for it very much. Sounds like that.
P11,00:36:38,T3,First,Offline,But also adapt like a dashboard that learns and adapts to based on usage. Does that mean we're gonna have to change the actual?
P13,00:36:46,T3,First,Offline,"Well, that would be very easy to present present."
P11,00:36:50,T3,First,Offline,Would it?
P13,00:36:50,T3,First,Offline,UI icons based on use.
P11,00:36:53,T3,First,Offline,Are sure?
P13,00:36:54,T3,First,Offline,Like rank them and then display them that way.
P11,00:36:58,T3,First,Offline,"I was thinking like an actual dashboard, which had moving Parts, okay. Cool cool. That makes sense."
P13,00:37:05,T3,First,Offline,This is very difficult to the point where I think it may need to be excluded.
P10,00:37:10,T3,First,Offline,Yeah.
P13,00:37:16,T3,First,Offline,This interests me because of its work of technological constraints and it seems to be like it's presented but.
P11,00:37:27,T3,First,Offline,"I like this one because dashboarding like I've done a bit of stuff elastic search, which is pretty good for that. And then is your like is well documented on."
P13,00:37:39,T3,First,Offline,Yeah.
P11,00:37:39,T3,First,Offline,So it has its angular which I guess I just like how reliable it is. I like thinking so much on stack Overflow for answers and they'll be there. You know.
P13,00:37:47,T3,First,Offline,I think I think that that is a hot Contender.
P11,00:37:49,T3,First,Offline,"Okay, I'm gonna like kind of boring but seems reliable if not."
P13,00:38:00,T3,First,Offline,Who are the F. Who Agile CIC?  Why is my phone turned itself off?
P11,00:38:09,T3,First,Offline,"Agile CIC are training consultant in Glasgow, Scotland. Nice, I mean you can meet with them all through suppose. Provides training and complimentary digital tools that enable those delivering Sports play in physical activity to maximize their impact."
P13,00:38:36,T3,First,Offline,"Okay. No, I instantly don't like this codes and interface."
P11,00:38:42,T3,First,Offline,Right.
P13,00:38:42,T3,First,Offline,"Okay, so Keep those words inmate code and interface right. This is someone who hasn't very profession or knows how to run web interface which reads users for the questions and a positive engaging way and design an effective approach to gathering the data. They want an app. This is an app. Create a useful data visualization tool and they want a back ends. Piece of software they want a nap and they won't back ends off."
P11,00:39:16,T3,First,Offline,"Well, it does say that they want an app."
P13,00:39:18,T3,First,Offline,Yeah.
P11,00:39:22,T3,First,Offline,To me. It just seemed like it would just be a form just a very kind of engaging.
P13,00:39:28,T3,First,Offline,"Yeah, right."
P11,00:39:29,T3,First,Offline,JavaScript.
P13,00:39:31,T3,First,Offline,By the way they won't critique how it works.
P11,00:39:34,T3,First,Offline,Which makes sense.
P13,00:39:37,T3,First,Offline,I like Craneware. I'm a fan of craneware. I'm smart grids. What do you think? You haven't you haven't been speaking of which I've been talking much.
P10,00:39:54,T3,First,Offline,"No no It just like I know what we have learned in these years, but I know that if I need to I don't think so."
P13,00:40:02,T3,First,Offline,What is your gut say about these projects?
P10,00:40:07,T3,First,Offline,"I mean for this one. I didn't really understand. But yeah, like Atari thing."
P13,00:40:17,T3,First,Offline,"That's this right here is very incoherent. It's very hard to pick out exactly what they're asking for. We're weather and data stats and it's like, okay if you've got them sure, that's great."
P11,00:40:30,T3,First,Offline,"It does say you have to pick them off all online and offline sources, right?"
P13,00:40:33,T3,First,Offline,"Yeah, right."
P11,00:40:34,T3,First,Offline,But this is easy to read it. Let's not just going to be like the grab stuff that we're doing.
P10,00:40:41,T3,First,Offline,"Foe this one, it seems easy. I'm just scared that maybe it's not but it doesn't seem like too bad, but I'm scared that maybe it's not and so I'm just."
P11,00:40:51,T3,First,Offline,It's just kind of the lack of detailed.
P10,00:40:54,T3,First,Offline,"Because it's just like if you see this one, this one has like four pages or like there's anything he said this one is like half a page."
P11,00:41:04,T3,First,Offline,Also do they even won three things or I don't
P10,00:41:11,T3,First,Offline,They don't really.
P13,00:41:36,T3,First,Offline,"So auto generating reports super easy. Based on usage like from a database selects from you know, because it's almost but that all sounds like."
P10,00:41:51,T3,First,Offline,"I mean, yeah, I would like to have something that is a bit of a challenge but even not too difficult."
P13,00:42:04,T3,First,Offline,Yeah.
P10,00:42:04,T3,First,Offline,And something that has like skills that I can use to.
P13,00:42:09,T3,First,Offline,I think using just one technology angular.
P11,00:42:13,T3,First,Offline,So this which one that one?
P13,00:42:15,T3,First,Offline,"Pretty much yeah. I mean it uses a zero, and Yeah,  angular 6 so that's something that's like something you can get good at over a period of time. I'm heavily waiting on this I'm thinking about it"
P10,00:42:42,T3,First,Offline,Are we going to listen to the presentation of the projects on something?
P13,00:42:46,T3,First,Offline,I think so
P10,00:42:46,T3,First,Offline,So maybe we can also see there like we can I think we can select a few projects that we like and then on the day we see how they present them and.
P11,00:42:58,T3,First,Offline,"Wait the clients are going to be coming in, are they?"
P13,00:43:00,T3,First,Offline,"Yeah, are."
P11,00:43:01,T3,First,Offline,Are they actually.
P13,00:43:02,T3,First,Offline,Yes.
P10,00:43:04,T3,First,Offline,We should be meeting.
P11,00:43:05,T3,First,Offline,Intersting.
P11,00:43:05,T3,First,Offline,So maybe like.
P13,00:43:07,T3,First,Offline,It takes like a good few hours the full thing.
P10,00:43:11,T3,First,Offline,"It should be like the entire day, right?"
P13,00:43:11,T3,First,Offline,Which is great that we've got this product certain to work over these right now. Yeah
P11,00:43:18,T3,First,Offline,Especially because when you when you like meet a person you get influenced by so much more than just for the actual project.
P10,00:43:24,T3,First,Offline,"Yeah, exactly I mean for this one, it's like this is how they prevented now, but maybe on the day it would be like much more."
P11,00:43:33,T3,First,Offline,True.
P10,00:43:34,T3,First,Offline,Detailed you will be like
P13,00:43:47,T3,First,Offline,"Oh, yeah, this is doing is acting asking for an honors for fucking asking for like you to design equipment and it's okay."
P10,00:44:03,T3,First,Offline,"Do you think like people you know, the Toronto can join software engineering can do it?"
P11,00:44:08,T3,First,Offline,No.
P10,00:44:15,T3,First,Offline,Someone will have to pick that.
P13,00:44:19,T3,First,Offline,This is interesting sort of. I haven't got to the bit. That's scary.
P11,00:44:25,T3,First,Offline,Which one is it?
P13,00:44:25,T3,First,Offline,System integration projects.
P11,00:44:28,T3,First,Offline,Oh Okay yeah
P13,00:44:35,T3,First,Offline,"Oh, I just got to the invoice or see our management. That's all that with the way it is which I won't PDF files present on screen and identify areas on the document that map's a real date. Have you ever dealt with a PDF before like the actual data behind a PDF this suck? No. Thank you. Maybe maybe demented. Yeah, okay."
P6,00:00:10,T2,First,Offline,Just tell us about this one tell us the objective that we can.
P7,00:00:15,T2,First,Offline,What I got of the objective is one of two choices. It's the first choice is they've got a bunch of camera software and Hardware that they want us to create demos for so that they can show a expressions or events to try and advertise themselves I spouse. But that would involve based on each different type of Hardware creating a different application. So we've got a couple different choices in that one or there's a wireless sensor system that would involve all of encryption and wireless interfacing. So I'm personally we're interested in the Machine Vision part of it.
P6,00:00:54,T2,First,Offline,Okay.
P7,00:00:56,T2,First,Offline,What about you guys?
P6,00:00:56,T2,First,Offline,know for that project. How would you define a successful?
P8,00:01:03,T2,First,Offline,Yeah a successful project
P6,00:01:03,T2,First,Offline,Project for this
P7,00:01:06,T2,First,Offline,I guess the successful project would be like at least in the case of I don't know. I'll pick the example of autonomous vehicles. I guess the successful example would be one that can process the environment around it properly tell what's moving in what direction what as a threat wasn't a threat distance between things just basically make sure it doesn't crash. I think that would be a pretty successful car.
P6,00:01:32,T2,First,Offline,So they've got this hardware Jetson TK1 anda they could have if say for example the developing for this. Are they going to give us this prototype for us to.
P7,00:01:48,T2,First,Offline,"I supposed to so. Yeah, I think that they would have to like cause I don't know how we develop for if we were."
P6,00:01:57,T2,First,Offline,If we don't okay.
P7,00:01:59,T2,First,Offline,"Yeah, if we don't have one"
P6,00:02:00,T2,First,Offline,Video processing for navigation road lane detection and stuff like that. You've got cars that can tell if you're drifting within the moment.
P8,00:02:10,T2,First,Offline,Yeah. Yeah. Make sure you go straight.
P6,00:02:14,T2,First,Offline,Okay.
P7,00:02:16,T2,First,Offline,All the other stuff like the object recognition that sort of stuff also quite useful like another interesting thing.
P6,00:02:29,T2,First,Offline,"Object recognition. I saw something on the TV while but somebody develop it that they were hap that can that can using a camera that can dictate different type of vehicles. So they could detect motorcycle Caravan or always you know, what they've got is a garbage I don't know how they do it. You can detect objects and tell you if it's a car a moving car stationary care."
P7,00:03:04,T2,First,Offline,Yeah.
P6,00:03:05,T2,First,Offline,"If the if the project doesn't succeed, what are the implications?"
P8,00:03:13,T2,First,Offline,Like with the autonomous vehicles obviously like impact would like a car crash.
P7,00:03:15,T2,First,Offline,Yeah.
P8,00:03:21,T2,First,Offline,"Or maybe like let's think about autonomous vehicles like you know how like we end up, you know, like in the normal like for us like a normal driver we would rather like get ourselves heard rather than get like hit anyone else."
P7,00:03:40,T2,First,Offline,Yeah.
P8,00:03:40,T2,First,Offline,"You know, like if you have someone on the road."
P6,00:03:42,T2,First,Offline,"Yeah, you will do that void colliding with somebody and drive yourself into it."
P8,00:03:47,T2,First,Offline,Yeah wit the autonomous vehicles the conflicts with one of their like tenements probably like keep the drivers safe.
P7,00:03:58,T2,First,Offline,Yeah.
P8,00:03:58,T2,First,Offline,So then they have to choose.
P6,00:04:00,T2,First,Offline,That's a huge ethical dilemma there.
P8,00:04:01,T2,First,Offline,Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
P7,00:04:02,T2,First,Offline,Defiantly yeah.
P8,00:04:02,T2,First,Offline,So that would be like the implication will be like the car autonomous vehicle choosing the wrong choice like the an ethical choice to avoid that.
P7,00:04:17,T2,First,Offline,"Yeah, because in situation of those f as an autonomous vehicle there is no one in the vehicle, then it may choose."
P8,00:04:25,T2,First,Offline,To crash yourself.
P7,00:04:27,T2,First,Offline,"To crash yourself, but also make sure all I should try and minimise the damage. So hits the other vehicle which could in turn caused injury to a person where no other person in that car was injured so."
P8,00:04:38,T2,First,Offline,I feel that that would be the location of where you and I are quite a bit more severe one.
P7,00:04:45,T2,First,Offline,"I don't think that the wisest project so important I think is important to them they said because they just want to be able to get there the ability of the technology at hardware out there just pretend it's basically just advertising for them, I guess. What is the case for change?"
P8,00:05:10,T2,First,Offline,I don't know what that means.
P7,00:05:11,T2,First,Offline,I don't know what that means.
P6,00:05:11,T2,First,Offline,What's the case for change?
P7,00:05:14,T2,First,Offline,I guess like what's the reason for this.
P6,00:05:17,T2,First,Offline,Yeah.
P7,00:05:17,T2,First,Offline,"Pretty much just advertising. I guess, they want to be able to show off what their software and Hardware can do so that people might buy it."
P8,00:05:27,T2,First,Offline,What are the key milestones?
P7,00:05:32,T2,First,Offline,Probably making so I don't know the thing you can actually detect what a supposed to detect.
P6,00:05:40,T2,First,Offline,Yes.
P7,00:05:41,T2,First,Offline,That's probably a major one.
P8,00:05:42,T2,First,Offline,"And then probably like be able to like calculate the maybe like instead of you know, like maybe calculate instead of like choosing you'd have to like compare so they would have like sort of like a percentage of risk."
P8,00:05:56,T2,First,Offline,Hmm.
P8,00:05:57,T2,First,Offline,"Like risk and then like all this lower risk, so probably that would be one of the milestones being able to calculate two different two different scenario two different choices and calculate the risk."
P6,00:06:09,T2,First,Offline,The risk.
P7,00:06:09,T2,First,Offline,And then pick.
P8,00:06:11,T2,First,Offline,Yeah.
P7,00:06:11,T2,First,Offline,Or what pragmatically which the best option would be
P6,00:06:15,T2,First,Offline,"What are the most important decision that need to be made? What would prevent us from making this decision?  First will you know for developing something like this, you have to like choose your development environment. You can use Python."
P8,00:06:39,T2,First,Offline,Yeah.
P6,00:06:39,T2,First,Offline,C++. What are the technologies out there like we can use.
P8,00:06:49,T2,First,Offline,Probably what prevents us from the decision is like the resources that we have.
P8,00:06:55,T2,First,Offline,Yeah.
P8,00:06:56,T2,First,Offline,Or we we don't have like the funding to like use the best equipment that we have.
P7,00:07:00,T2,First,Offline,"Also potentially like how comfortable each of us feel and a specific development environment makes tears away from that development environment. I would say one of the other important choices would be actually packing one of these potential projects to do if we don't go with for example senses, then."
P6,00:07:20,T2,First,Offline,The senses. Yes.
P7,00:07:21,T2,First,Offline,I have got good amount of different things to. Do you guys have any other projects that you wanted to like bring up and discuss or we're gonna do this one?
P6,00:07:30,T2,First,Offline,Lets answer questions on this one and then we could.
P7,00:07:34,T2,First,Offline,See where that goes. Yeah.
P8,00:07:36,T2,First,Offline,"Yeah,."
P7,00:07:36,T2,First,Offline,"Okay. The biggest obstacles to getting this done, probably learning how to use the image processing."
P8,00:07:46,T2,First,Offline,Yes.
P7,00:07:47,T2,First,Offline,Because we will have no former experience at all or like that so probably was the biggest one will be getting it understood and then getting the camera turned on.
P6,00:07:57,T2,First,Offline,I'm not too sure if will release of the students we also might have to go to their premises.
P8,00:08:03,T2,First,Offline,Yeah.
P6,00:08:03,T2,First,Offline,To use them.
P8,00:08:06,T2,First,Offline,There's also like a factor lifetime but I think this sort of project like too big for a year for the whole academic uni to be done. I think that will extent to a couple more years.
P7,00:08:18,T2,First,Offline,"Potentially, I guess I guess if it was like every was filled balloons like we had to like design like a full car. I think maybe take a few years, but I think I think as far as like these cool. It's just kind of getting the the environment understood and then getting the very basics of like the camera operating so they can show off and be like this camera can detect people walking by."
P8,00:08:40,T2,First,Offline,True true true
P7,00:08:40,T2,First,Offline,Which again it can probably be a thing if it was an autonomous car have to.
P8,00:08:47,T2,First,Offline,Yeah.
P7,00:08:48,T2,First,Offline,"Like if I was going to steer away from a different car, I could, it would have to look as if there is any pedestrian instead so you don't get to a bigger damage."
P6,00:08:57,T2,First,Offline,Who are the key stakeholders ?
P7,00:09:02,T2,First,Offline,Census probably.
P6,00:09:02,T2,First,Offline,Their client will going to be.
P8,00:09:06,T2,First,Offline,School
P7,00:09:06,T2,First,Offline,I don't think we're developing this for like their clients. I think we're developing it just for them to display.
P6,00:09:15,T2,First,Offline,To display for their client. Potential client to see.
P7,00:09:20,T2,First,Offline,"Yeah, that's fair point"
P8,00:09:21,T2,First,Offline,Who influences but doesn't own probably like the general public I guess.
P7,00:09:26,T2,First,Offline,"Yeah, the general public potential buyers of their technology just anyone who is looking to develop pretty much just car companies surveillance companies. I mean if we went from like the value of the shape size and volume of a box is one task then Industrial Automation we could go for that. And then in that case the influences changes to just factory owners and companies owned factories within the UK that buy this product. I don't think we answer the responses."
P6,00:10:02,T2,First,Offline,Then potential employer they're going to lose their job.
P7,00:10:05,T2,First,Offline,Oh boy.
P6,00:10:05,T2,First,Offline,They're going to be happy what you guys have done.
P7,00:10:05,T2,First,Offline,Who has potential to be obstacle? I feel like whoever will the corresponding with will probably be not a lot really if we were to describe anyone as an obstacle to probably be them and the expectations clearly we would have based on what they want to be able to show to the customers.
P6,00:10:34,T2,First,Offline,What are the projects greatest assets?
P7,00:10:40,T2,First,Offline,"I feel going down the road of image processing and machine versions are very to me at least is quite interesting. But also it's probably not too common to have just like a set of silks and all you know how to work with this like it kind of set like general idea of the processing machine version, which if automation is going to become more widespread than machine version would be to become more widespread so I can see if we could potentially becoming quite a useful skill to have."
P6,00:11:18,T2,First,Offline,This one one face recognition module optimisation and development of products for sale from vending machines. What are they driving on that?
P7,00:11:29,T2,First,Offline,"I don't know like why would you need facial recognition to buy from a vending machine, is it may be to see like what people feel when they buy from vending machines?"
P8,00:11:40,T2,First,Offline,You know a type person comes up to vending machine and automatically the vending machine which is an energy drink for that person.
P6,00:11:54,T2,First,Offline,That will be wired
P7,00:11:54,T2,First,Offline,and then in that case like the ethical quandary of like what if they give them something that they're all their allergic to.
P8,00:11:59,T2,First,Offline,Oh true
P6,00:11:58,T2,First,Offline,"It's like I will have this energy bar and person is allergic to peanuts, but the machine suggested so. How we can we best leverage the assets of the project. I would say. all right. Okay, it means that physical assets I spouse"
P8,00:12:21,T2,First,Offline,TRUE
P7,00:12:21,T2,First,Offline,Probably. I would say the best assets would be the fact that it's new technology that the company develop themselves.
P8,00:12:28,T2,First,Offline,Yeah.
P7,00:12:28,T2,First,Offline,"So they'd have a very intimate know how it works to be able to get it to us or with or we'd at least have a decent access to the software and the hardware and I guess. Best leverage of those assets, I don't really know"
P8,00:12:44,T2,First,Offline,How are you going to use the assets the best.
P8,00:12:47,T2,First,Offline,"I don't know, to do the project."
P7,00:12:49,T2,First,Offline,Probably.
P6,00:12:49,T2,First,Offline,What are the most important to you is we should always focus on?
P7,00:12:58,T2,First,Offline,Probably making sure that the code is readable because I mean if this is just a demo that it used to be well document.
P6,00:13:04,T2,First,Offline,We're making sure that you know after we even if we don't finish your project some.
P8,00:13:09,T2,First,Offline,Someone else picking up could finish it. Yeah.
P6,00:13:11,T2,First,Offline,"Yeah they can take it in the house and we finished its maintainable, you know, follow follow the all the best, what's the word?"
P8,00:13:23,T2,First,Offline,Requirements?
P6,00:13:24,T2,First,Offline,Industrial standards.
P8,00:13:28,T2,First,Offline,Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
P7,00:13:28,T2,First,Offline,"Yeah, we would need to definitely keep up to that your'r right?"
P6,00:13:33,T2,First,Offline,"Just like Tim said it's not actually about the end product though even if the function input is good, was about the process of how we have to forget that following best engineering practices some software engineering practices and things like that."
P7,00:13:49,T2,First,Offline,Like if we finish it but it's not documented. It's also kind of so useless because they don't know.
P6,00:13:54,T2,First,Offline,They can get even somebody to say I have no function
P7,00:13:54,T2,First,Offline,I guess in that case it will be creating our jobs for ourselves because we would have to come back to like how dose this work.
P6,00:14:10,T2,First,Offline,One of the projects had similar issue like that. They couldn't get back to the guys to have them do things. They didn't own the IP for the software.
P8,00:14:19,T2,First,Offline,Okay.
P6,00:14:19,T2,First,Offline,So it was all so now they have tried to state more a few things.
P6,00:14:32,T2,First,Offline,"Potential problem, last year students have development project was a success for us, but not without some excerpts from which lessons have been drown. One, we must a agree for intellectual property assignment to the task. Two, they had all data generated from it must be hosted securely on the trust of in server.  Last yea,. they are some they had lots of functions and some data records for several months when the third party server went on the renew that contact could not be made with the developers."
P8,00:15:13,T2,First,Offline,"All right. Yeah,."
P6,00:15:14,T2,First,Offline,The cost should be given complete source code for future maintenance and operations development of application the option be operational in full compliance with GDPR regulations.
P7,00:15:30,T2,First,Offline,I don't know what GDPR is.
P6,00:15:30,T2,First,Offline,Is that new thing where if we will send you yeah to like to say is like.
P7,00:15:35,T2,First,Offline,Data privacy stuff. I think that sort of stuff be kind of requirement for all projects. It's defiantly a good idea if we like even if the company doesn't for the put that forward to is that we put that for forward and say we're going to do this is easier for you in the future. I think will give us brownie points.
P6,00:16:00,T2,First,Offline,Yeah how much I'm not sure which risks are you willing to take to accomplish this?
P7,00:16:08,T2,First,Offline,"Enough risk, I spouse."
P8,00:16:11,T2,First,Offline,Enough risk
P7,00:16:11,T2,First,Offline,"Just enough risk just because I've I would like to I'd be very interested in doing any of these but I don't think I think like if it got to the point where it was lately if it was later in the year, we start a lot to do I end up probably wanting to prioritize studying for my exams and making sure that instead the documentation for this was up to scratch that they could continue on themselves."
P6,00:16:36,T2,First,Offline,Because they're not supposed to use chip liver. Anyway.
P7,00:16:41,T2,First,Offline,We didn't get paid for this? It's not fair. We get paid in course credits.
P6,00:16:50,T2,First,Offline,"If you look on the bright side, we are now like having to come up with project in our own."
P7,00:17:00,T2,First,Offline,"Yeah, at least as that."
P6,00:17:00,T2,First,Offline,So we've got people who are the does about a project. I have a meaningful that could possibly have a meaningful impact. You know.
P7,00:17:09,T2,First,Offline,Plus we off don't have to pay for any licensing fees or technology or Hardware.
P8,00:17:13,T2,First,Offline,True.
P6,00:17:13,T2,First,Offline,"Yeah. What barriers have you encountered in the past about this issue?  I don't know, with this issue or issues are we talking about."
P7,00:17:26,T2,First,Offline,All the issues.
P6,00:17:28,T2,First,Offline,What keeps you up at night about this?
P7,00:17:30,T2,First,Offline,I don't know.
P6,00:17:31,T2,First,Offline,Nothing because it cause health problems.
P7,00:17:33,T2,First,Offline,The first thing to come into contact.
P8,00:17:34,T2,First,Offline,Yeah.
P7,00:17:34,T2,First,Offline,"Have a time to sleep on it. I feel like in future may be one of the bigger problems could be just making sure that we actually also understand how like there's said that we'd be using image processing packages like in vitek, none of us have used that before and not really assume that anyone heard of that before but it may be a bit of a a early obstacle in something that would maybe stick around in my mind that I need to make sure I really understand that."
P6,00:18:06,T2,First,Offline,I'm not a big fan of having to learn new things. I want to stay away from it as much as I can. That's why all those Matlab in that class.
P8,00:18:21,T2,First,Offline,"Oh, yeah simulations."
P6,00:18:22,T2,First,Offline,"I'm like F, I don't want know"
P6,00:18:26,T2,First,Offline,I don't even touch Matlab  at all. What topics haven't we discussed? What topics would you rather not discuss?
P8,00:18:37,T2,First,Offline,In relation to what?
P8,00:18:40,T2,First,Offline,True.
P6,00:18:41,T2,First,Offline,It's a bit vague.
P7,00:18:42,T2,First,Offline,That is a lot of a vague question.
P8,00:18:44,T2,First,Offline,Yeah.
P7,00:18:44,T2,First,Offline,"We haven't really discussed potentially how would contact the company if they'd be available for our hours or if we have to work around their times sort of stuff. What topics which rather not discuss? In depth rather what we'd do as supposed of which these we haven't really discussed and I'd rather not discuss for now until at least like all four of it was here that will be fine. Rather not discuss exactly what we're choosing right now, until they all four of us are then we can make an actual inform decision that everyone's happier with."
P6,00:19:27,T2,First,Offline,What is your personal passion about this project? What will this mean to you when we succeed?
P7,00:19:34,T2,First,Offline,Well.
P7,00:19:35,T2,First,Offline,Go ahead.
P7,00:19:35,T2,First,Offline,"No no, go ahead"
P8,00:19:34,T2,First,Offline,"I mean, I guess like it's say like for example, like I think for example like this project on an autonomous vehicle, I guess like the biggest risk right now is because if it is it's not widespread if it has been successful like imagine like like right now like maybe like a fraction of the cars on the road autonomous, but once like every single car is autonomous, I think it would be like more safer than having us at the road rather than you know because I have all the autonomous cars will be like up. We'll have the same."
P7,00:20:09,T2,First,Offline,Software.
P8,00:20:10,T2,First,Offline,Same software and then.
P7,00:20:12,T2,First,Offline,So they always have the same priorities.
P8,00:20:14,T2,First,Offline,Yeah.
P7,00:20:14,T2,First,Offline,They will be able to keep it safe. We can build fraction of car robots.
P6,00:21:08,T2,First,Offline,"I mean realistically despite, you know people's objections autonomous vehicles is going to happen."
P8,00:21:15,T2,First,Offline,Yeah.
P7,00:21:15,T2,First,Offline,Yes.
P6,00:21:16,T2,First,Offline,It's just a matter time.
P7,00:21:17,T2,First,Offline,And subjectively safer.
P6,00:21:18,T2,First,Offline,Because they will start to find them in my opinion first would be like places like airport transfers look like between terminals.
P8,00:21:26,T2,First,Offline,"Yeah,."
P6,00:21:26,T2,First,Offline,"You know, they think the city before them for things like that at first, you know, they would have like their own lane."
P7,00:21:33,T2,First,Offline,Yeah.
P6,00:21:34,T2,First,Offline,The cars just stick to that.
P7,00:21:35,T2,First,Offline,Yeah. Yeah.
P6,00:21:43,T2,First,Offline,"Yeah, I mean at the moment you've got cars like pad themselves."
P7,00:21:47,T2,First,Offline,"Yeah. I would say parking lot of see what of hard across the driving on, so I've got that then the rest of drivers can avoid."
P6,00:21:57,T2,First,Offline,"Those cars they can really do. Well you can power the fact nicely, you know, which I'm quite jealous of as well."
P7,00:22:14,T2,First,Offline,You want to do other things to say like I'd be very personally interested in doing any of these because I'm very interested in Machine Vision as like a thing. I think I mentioned it just before we started recording actually the one of my main can have interests in terms of workplaces after I finish my degree or potentially even internships would be with the rise of Automation and Automation and all other sectors like retail and stuff would probably bear Machine Vision software for like a security that's sort of stuff. So I can see being a very employable skill in the future but also kind of interested in doing it as a hobby as well.
P6,00:23:03,T2,First,Offline,Even the vision will be for like your survival people to come pick up objects like in a warehouse for posting to Consumers you could have robots are using automation and using Visions like this they can recognize objects.
P8,00:23:26,T2,First,Offline,"Yeah,."
P6,00:23:27,T2,First,Offline,Just pick them out.
P7,00:23:29,T2,First,Offline,"Yeah, there's like bring them back the counter yeah. What would this mean to you when we succeed?"
P6,00:23:37,T2,First,Offline,Then be able to make more money because he doesn't need a lot of people.
P8,00:23:41,T2,First,Offline,Yeah.
P7,00:23:42,T2,First,Offline,What will this mean to you when succeed? I like that not if we succeed when we succeed.
P6,00:23:50,T2,First,Offline,It says of a fulfilment to do something that works.
P8,00:23:56,T2,First,Offline,Yeah.
P7,00:23:57,T2,First,Offline,That's always nice.
P6,00:23:58,T2,First,Offline,The fulfilment like we did something and it's working.
P7,00:24:06,T2,First,Offline,And then we have big skill set to go foreword.
P7,00:24:08,T2,First,Offline,And then there's like also.
P6,00:24:10,T2,First,Offline,You can brag about it
P7,00:24:10,T2,First,Offline,Yep
P8,00:24:10,T2,First,Offline,"Yeah, if it  dose happen you know seeing that it's being used everywhere. That's a like if you do like machine likes the smart camera official recognition mode knowing that, you know, some of the things that you're using our like what we would worked on would be like very."
P7,00:24:35,T2,First,Offline,To use
P6,00:24:35,T2,First,Offline,Yeah.
P8,00:24:36,T2,First,Offline,Yeah. Yeah.
P7,00:24:43,T2,First,Offline,"It's also good against because then we've got like the industry connection of a company that employs an area that we're now scaled. So it's a very safe fall back in that way. Probably, anything else to discuss?"
P15,00:00:00,T4,First,Offline,This like Shakespeare's text or something and puts them and I do not want to do that at all.
P17,00:00:20,T4,First,Offline,Okay that's OK
P15,00:00:20,T4,First,Offline,"This is pretty fun, actually. It's like a. It's related to physics and astronomy."
P17,00:00:31,T4,First,Offline,OK
P15,00:00:31,T4,First,Offline,Collecting data from sensors about I don't know weather or something some interface with the system will require development preferably so not a specific devices such as smartphones. What's the app?
P17,00:00:49,T4,First,Offline,"Well, I mean there's something about back-end onto a Jaglal CIC , since I'm. It seems just like really boring. It just like you know provides a sports and physical activity sector with training include digital tools and blah blah blah. This is really interesting."
P15,00:01:17,T4,First,Offline,"App development proposal, which is nice"
P17,00:01:17,T4,First,Offline,That's exactly right especially because it's princess trust.
P15,00:01:24,T4,First,Offline,Yeah
P17,00:01:24,T4,First,Offline,"Which is a big company,  big charity, I think so in that sense, it's seems interesting and might have a lot to offer but you know as I would need to read through what exactly is this project what's the app."
P15,00:01:38,T4,First,Offline,"A downloadable mobile application which maximizes young person engagement facilitates the organisation and attendance of in-centre activities and develops an integrated culture of return visits. This is very good, you know proposal because they have actually told us what they want."
P17,00:01:58,T4,First,Offline,"They have clear idea, that's what I'm saying , they have experience with, you know a job like this. For example, this seems like they have no idea what I have no idea what they're doing. It's like they just wanted some kind of and analyzing data."
P15,00:02:09,T4,First,Offline,Even on this thing because it's going to start me one this this is talk about what they're doing. What the hell of any idea of what they want us to do.
P14,00:02:14,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, maybe like conversations with the customers is going to be hard because they."
P15,00:02:20,T4,First,Offline,Yea.
P14,00:02:20,T4,First,Offline,They don't really know.
P15,00:02:22,T4,First,Offline,Have no idea what they want.
P14,00:02:23,T4,First,Offline,Okay.
P15,00:02:23,T4,First,Offline,We have no idea what to give them anyways.
P17,00:02:27,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P15,00:02:28,T4,First,Offline,Proposed back in features . Maybe we want to talk about this guys. It's good.
P17,00:02:34,T4,First,Offline,"Well, this one is you like really really interesting because it's like they're have a clear idea of what they want. It's working with like spacecraft engineering blah blah blah, and but there's two proposed projects one is like a neural network based arcade game which sounds pretty cool cause I'm like the kind of neural networking and all that so that and then there's satellite and simulation, which is like me but it might be cool still so I don't know but I definitely did the fact that is you know."
P15,00:03:03,T4,First,Offline,I that like two different things?
P17,00:03:04,T4,First,Offline,Yeah. They have a pretty clear idea of what they want. They seem like they have a lot of experience.
P15,00:03:14,T4,First,Offline,"We actually need to make sure that we you know, we are able to do it."
P17,00:03:19,T4,First,Offline,Yes.
P15,00:03:20,T4,First,Offline,There's already github for these guys the neural navigate advances in machine learning. So we're not doing machine learning. Are you guys taking machine learning?
P17,00:03:33,T4,First,Offline,This semester though yeah.
P15,00:03:33,T4,First,Offline,I will take it next year
P14,00:03:34,T4,First,Offline,AI I'm taking AI this year.
P17,00:03:40,T4,First,Offline,It's gonna be a lot to put on that.
P15,00:03:42,T4,First,Offline,Have to be.
P14,00:03:44,T4,First,Offline,I was scared to do machine learning I thing it's too much maths..
P17,00:03:47,T4,First,Offline,"Maybe your're right. Anyways, yeah, that seems like a nice. This is like chance though which is great. Also, I guess it really depends on what we want to get out of the project. What are theses, is the questions that we need to answer."
P15,00:03:59,T4,First,Offline,We could ask ourselves.
P17,00:04:01,T4,First,Offline,What are the objectives? How do you define success?
P14,00:04:07,T4,First,Offline,"If the project doesn't succeed, what are the implications?."
P15,00:04:10,T4,First,Offline,Why does the project important? The neural network. I mean it's.
P17,00:04:14,T4,First,Offline,What are the other things do you have?
P15,00:04:16,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P14,00:04:17,T4,First,Offline,"This one is Evidence-Based Nutritional Support App. In this project we propose the development of a prototype mobile app to provide, concise, research led, nutritional information to educate families and the general public in an engaging but simple and easy to understand manner. So this one is proposed by Mrs Janette McBride, Prof. Mike Lean and Dr. Laura Moss. Mrs McBride is working she works in the University of Glasgow, so."
P15,00:04:51,T4,First,Offline,They wanted professionally made Health app.
P17,00:04:56,T4,First,Offline,These these these guys also seemed kind of interesting there are pretty much not that far from there. It's kind of like a sports lab something so they like do like very high in sports testing and stuff and what they want is app that could based on the sound device thing be able to track like the height of the bounce of the ball or something.
P14,00:05:20,T4,First,Offline,Oh
P17,00:05:19,T4,First,Offline,That's what I understood.
P15,00:05:22,T4,First,Offline,"Help depend on the material of the ball, that's very challenging."
P17,00:05:25,T4,First,Offline,But if you use a good neural network you could do it.
P15,00:05:31,T4,First,Offline,It depends on surface is bouncing on depends on the material of the bowl a lot of factors.
P17,00:05:39,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P15,00:05:39,T4,First,Offline,Is that even possible?
P17,00:05:39,T4,First,Offline,I don't know
P15,00:05:45,T4,First,Offline,"It wouldn't be a hundred percent accurate, but nothing say we percent accurate."
P14,00:05:50,T4,First,Offline,Okay. This one is external relation. A relation is a relation to some of that makeup University services for the University of Glasgow. We would like students next you don't seem to work on a solution to managing this increase in volume of application and course in Paris many of which are repetitive all the intake of significant staff resources to answer.
P15,00:06:15,T4,First,Offline,An automatic.
P14,00:06:16,T4,First,Offline,A filter for your email.
P15,00:06:18,T4,First,Offline,Like an automatic rep replying system or something like that.
P14,00:06:23,T4,First,Offline,We are seeking ways in which we could respond to devolve inquires into more resource efficient way or ways in which we could reduce them develop by directing inquires to other channels for information.
P15,00:06:35,T4,First,Offline,Make like buttons for a quick replies. Like do this go to Mike my campus and do this. They don't have to type it in and it is simpler than the other ones.
P17,00:06:47,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P15,00:06:48,T4,First,Offline,It's a way simpler than the other ones.
P17,00:06:50,T4,First,Offline,I mean like this sounds pretty interesting as well and they have the say like they are regularly work with major sports governing bodies just FIFA World rugby and all that and they have access to about 600 Fields where you test all these bouncing.
P15,00:07:12,T4,First,Offline,That's very nice.
P17,00:07:13,T4,First,Offline,"So, I mean if you don't mind guys."
P15,00:07:15,T4,First,Offline,"I mean, I love sports. So yeah, I don't mind at all."
P17,00:07:17,T4,First,Offline,"Sports. Yeah. Yeah If you don't mind, I will keep that away."
P15,00:07:30,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P17,00:07:30,T4,First,Offline,That' one I don't really know what they want.
P14,00:07:30,T4,First,Offline,Really?
P15,00:07:30,T4,First,Offline,Adaptable reporting in adjustable and useful way we would like to see reporting dashboard and learns and adapts based on usage.
P17,00:07:40,T4,First,Offline,Yeah doing the report on something they like I don't have a clear idea of what they should report.
P15,00:07:46,T4,First,Offline,"Outside of the third project, but I'm not sure where this would qualify convert an angular JS app into angular 6."
P14,00:07:50,T4,First,Offline,Yes.
P17,00:08:00,T4,First,Offline,We're looking for a confident.
P15,00:08:01,T4,First,Offline,"In as you can see are some guidelines for equipment design that will apply the accuracy of the system, of course calibration of equipment portability of the equipment error management. What do they want to the one and an app or create a new product? It will be completely new device. Y"
P17,00:08:25,T4,First,Offline,Yeah that is a cool part.
P15,00:08:27,T4,First,Offline,I mean you want this device to be cross-platform smartphone app. Either will being used by either our technicians and ground them to conduct assessment and.
P14,00:08:36,T4,First,Offline,Advice.
P15,00:08:38,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, or a smartphone app."
P17,00:08:44,T4,First,Offline,"Here these guys seem kind of interesting things like a pretty easy thing to do by the way, but it's basically a pain association in Scotland they help people manage showing chronic pain and the problem is with excessive people and rural areas. So they want the way to give out information to them. So basically at the chart, you know, like it online course basically thing especially for them."
P15,00:09:09,T4,First,Offline,It's very simple.
P17,00:09:10,T4,First,Offline,Should we put it there just in case we want to because they have like. So what's that?
P14,00:09:14,T4,First,Offline,"We have a OBASHI which is a company but it's a small company, my  friends working there. Okay here they're probably really was like to propose a project that elevates this problem by only displaying sensitive data when it is encrypted, what problem? Displaying financial or medical information on a screen or in a report provides the opportunity for others to view potentially sensitive information which should be kept away from prying eyes."
P15,00:09:44,T4,First,Offline,"Okay, so when they're like accessing records all their screens they don't want people to actually see those records."
P14,00:09:57,T4,First,Offline,"Yes, only display sensitise data when it is encrypted. This would appear amongst the non-sensitive unencrypted information. Information would be encrypted for your eyes only and only the nominated recipient would be able to decrypt it."
P17,00:10:12,T4,First,Offline,"So they are expecting as in like, I'm looking at screen you're looking."
P15,00:10:15,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P17,00:10:16,T4,First,Offline,But I see the information
P15,00:10:18,T4,First,Offline,I don't think that's what they want or I think it's like.
P17,00:10:20,T4,First,Offline,Okay you get it.
P15,00:10:20,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, I think it's like just an authentication that if the person you know, let's say a lobbyist not a lobbyist a receptionist has the information open on a screen and then someone walks in someone asks something and she opens the file, right? Let's say a hospitable opens their file and then someone else is like standing right beside them so they could see the health records when they open files, right so they can see the other person could potentially see the clients health records. So some records to be encrypted. So people can't see them until they're actually, you know, someone authenticate themselves and then use them."
P14,00:11:00,T4,First,Offline,There's for the decryption. We'd like to be able to point the camera or microphone at the screen or paper output and have the image so that.
P15,00:11:09,T4,First,Offline,The decrypted information.
P14,00:11:10,T4,First,Offline,In place of the encrypted information. The only way to get information will be using the smartphone screen as a description. Let's commence with the decryption tied to specific user and only that user.
P15,00:11:21,T4,First,Offline,"You know, that's that's actually really cool because we what could do."
P14,00:11:25,T4,First,Offline,It's cool. Is it hard?
P15,00:11:28,T4,First,Offline,I think we have like learn you learn new things.
P17,00:11:32,T4,First,Offline,Learn encrypting
P15,00:11:34,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, encrypting and decrypting and also reading codes through the we could use QR codes to decide what the encryption and decryption key are and then according to that it shows information, but then we'd have to, that's a lot."
P14,00:11:52,T4,First,Offline,They will sure the development aspects of their current platform with students and would require students working on this project to sign IP rights.
P15,00:12:00,T4,First,Offline,"Now there is two things that can be here, either the information. I'm putting this here.  The information could appear on the phone screen like, you know, let's say that this is blacked out. Okay, and I put my phone or here and then pretty much it appears here when I move it inside it or just very simple thing would be that the QR code takes them to you know a document."
P17,00:12:27,T4,First,Offline,"You know, like you have got so that you get a issue evolved over accept requested a new PIN for your bank card and you get that sticker thing that suddenly makes it, you know, you can be do the same thing with the camera. So you get like a blank space."
P15,00:12:43,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P17,00:12:43,T4,First,Offline,Just look through it through camera. You've got all that.
P15,00:12:46,T4,First,Offline,The only the only thing is I feel like we'd have to indulge in AR.
P17,00:12:50,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P15,00:12:52,T4,First,Offline,As you go into AR for that.
P17,00:12:54,T4,First,Offline,"Well, maybe not necessarily, all you need is like a image recognizing app something that we can read through and when it recognizes a black coding."
P15,00:13:09,T4,First,Offline,"I think the very easiest part would be every every interrupted part has its own ID and everything is decrypted. Not just a single QR code, you know to okay, I think of you are going to identify the actual file but then everything."
P17,00:13:25,T4,First,Offline,"Therefore, what we have to create you have to create a decrypting thing and encrypting thing. The encrypting part pretty much has to be a new version of word ward like Office Word Microsoft office this because like imagine like theses the example possible your nurse typing in the information until you're going to save the whole thing. But you want to do you want to."
P15,00:13:47,T4,First,Offline,Encrypt something.
P17,00:13:48,T4,First,Offline,"Yes, we should be able to select that stuff."
P17,00:13:49,T4,First,Offline,But what we could do is not really do that rather than selecting stuff to encrypt we could have special categories that are already encrypted. You know.
P17,00:13:59,T4,First,Offline,As like name and date
P15,00:14:01,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P17,00:14:01,T4,First,Offline,So someone has to select it.
P15,00:14:08,T4,First,Offline,I think the only challenge here the proper challenge you would be to.
P17,00:14:13,T4,First,Offline,Learn decryption.
P15,00:14:14,T4,First,Offline,"Learning encryption ,decryption and to show it on the phone screen as well through the camera. I think this is pretty good. It's different than the other ones it."
P17,00:14:27,T4,First,Offline,But it does not give me that strong with talk.
P15,00:14:36,T4,First,Offline,I think this is very difficult.
P17,00:14:39,T4,First,Offline,What was about this or you did't read it.
P14,00:14:43,T4,First,Offline,No I haven't
P17,00:14:43,T4,First,Offline,Is there any more?
P15,00:14:45,T4,First,Offline,"This is the only one. Yeah, that is very difficult."
P14,00:14:55,T4,First,Offline,What is it about?
P15,00:14:58,T4,First,Offline,"It's a lot of physics space for CERN, find applications in radiation background the term blah blah blah. Micro manager is a plug-in for an open source image analysis package ImageJ.  IJ is written in Java while MM in C++ and Java both packages have modular structure and that dedicated APIs. The proposed group project will extend existing and bring new functionality to the MM software for Medipix detector. This can be broadly split into several avenues to have a non-linear development path and give each student in the group their own piece of work. So there's three paths Improvement of the MM core for development of new MM functionality for Medipix, whatever that is, no idea. Medipix is state-of-the-art multi pixel detector of radiation."
P14,00:15:51,T4,First,Offline,Oh
P15,00:15:52,T4,First,Offline,"Okay development of educational software integration capability. Oh, no, this is this is definitely not a third-year project."
P14,00:16:02,T4,First,Offline,it's hard.
P15,00:16:02,T4,First,Offline,It's really difficult.
P17,00:16:03,T4,First,Offline,Go on throw it away
P17,00:16:03,T4,First,Offline,I have got this. This is basically an app where you can you spot we're Sparrows are having the nests and all that.
P15,00:16:22,T4,First,Offline,Yeah. Okay.
P14,00:16:23,T4,First,Offline,What? About what?
P17,00:16:26,T4,First,Offline,Sparrow
P15,00:16:26,T4,First,Offline,Sparrow app. Sparrows Nest
P17,00:16:26,T4,First,Offline,Yes.
P15,00:16:30,T4,First,Offline,So we have to identify Sparrow Nest?
P17,00:16:32,T4,First,Offline,"Well, no, they apparently have app for that you just have somehow make it a community of people that you know, look for that."
P15,00:16:38,T4,First,Offline,We need a social app of people.
P17,00:16:43,T4,First,Offline,Yeah something like that.
P15,00:16:45,T4,First,Offline,"For like to spot Sparrow Nest. Yeah, I dob't think I wan to do that."
P17,00:16:47,T4,First,Offline,Yeah I don't care about this.
P15,00:16:47,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, it's easy but it's not fun at all."
P17,00:16:55,T4,First,Offline,Exactly. I don't care too much about this.
P15,00:16:58,T4,First,Offline,Asking for several employers design third interlinked about provide it conservation mapping and monitoring tool.
P17,00:17:05,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P15,00:17:08,T4,First,Offline,We have way better options.
P17,00:17:11,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P15,00:17:11,T4,First,Offline,All right.
P17,00:17:12,T4,First,Offline,Should we spread them out?
P14,00:17:13,T4,First,Offline,Yes.
P15,00:17:14,T4,First,Offline,I think we should.
P17,00:17:26,T4,First,Offline,"Should we cote for these questions at some point? What topics keeps you up at night about this? Well, nothing really. How much risk you're willing to take to accomplish this? What are the most important areas?"
P15,00:17:38,T4,First,Offline,"Okay, first of all, what do you like most?"
P17,00:17:42,T4,First,Offline,"I don't think I'm a preference. I mean, I really like this ball bouncing thing."
P15,00:17:47,T4,First,Offline,Okay.
P17,00:17:47,T4,First,Offline,I also like the neural network thing.
P15,00:17:49,T4,First,Offline,Okay.
P17,00:17:50,T4,First,Offline,And there was something else as well that I liked. But I mean with anything except for the encryption key. Y I'm not a big fan of.
P15,00:17:59,T4,First,Offline,"Okay, just because you would have to learn encryption/decryption."
P17,00:18:03,T4,First,Offline,I don't mind learning it. It's just that not that interesting.
P15,00:18:08,T4,First,Offline,"Okay. What else, what about you?"
P14,00:18:11,T4,First,Offline,Which I liked?
P15,00:18:12,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P14,00:18:12,T4,First,Offline,I think I'm like all of these projects. What was this?
P17,00:18:20,T4,First,Offline,That's a bowl of just bouncing thing. That's the new device in Scotland.
P14,00:18:23,T4,First,Offline,And this one?
P15,00:18:24,T4,First,Offline,That was in the neural network based game.
P14,00:18:27,T4,First,Offline,It's a game.
P17,00:18:28,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P14,00:18:29,T4,First,Offline,"Okay. Yeah, I think I all of them. This one with the NHS."
P15,00:18:39,T4,First,Offline,The health app.
P14,00:18:39,T4,First,Offline,Yes.
P17,00:18:39,T4,First,Offline,What was the health app again?
P14,00:18:39,T4,First,Offline,It's like to make an app with nutrition and.
P15,00:18:46,T4,First,Offline,Nutrition information.
P14,00:18:48,T4,First,Offline,Provide concise research lab nutrition information.
P15,00:18:52,T4,First,Offline,"What they say is that the identify 28,000 mobile Health apps, but only 0.05 percent of them were developed in coordination with professional input. So what they want is to make a really good app using, you know, help professors and stuff like that."
P17,00:19:13,T4,First,Offline,We can skip that
P15,00:19:21,T4,First,Offline,"What was that? Well, that's a pain one for rural areas."
P17,00:19:25,T4,First,Offline,"Oh, yeah."
P15,00:19:28,T4,First,Offline,That's not bad actually.
P17,00:19:28,T4,First,Offline,That's the reason why we put that there because it's easy.
P15,00:19:32,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, it's very easy."
P17,00:19:33,T4,First,Offline,It's very easy. Yeah.
P15,00:19:34,T4,First,Offline,Extremely simple.
P17,00:19:35,T4,First,Offline,"I mean, it's also like to talk about success of the ideas and I think we should discuss that as well."
P15,00:19:42,T4,First,Offline,The success of the ideas.
P17,00:19:42,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, so."
P15,00:19:44,T4,First,Offline,I think that's a lot of something that's not been touched yet much.
P17,00:19:49,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P15,00:19:49,T4,First,Offline,"And if something like that happens, that's very successful."
P17,00:19:52,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, or could be has could be."
P15,00:19:54,T4,First,Offline,Yeah has a lot of potential.
P17,00:19:56,T4,First,Offline,"I think the pain managing and the this porch light bouncing thing I re-targeted. So therefore they will have success in the given, you know targets as for the health managing. I think that will be a total bust because you know. That was not even."
P15,00:20:16,T4,First,Offline,No body is gonna use that much
P17,00:20:16,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, nobody cares about being health professionals as long as they have, you know, Instagram professionals."
P15,00:20:31,T4,First,Offline,"Wait, what's this one?"
P17,00:20:33,T4,First,Offline,Look at these do as well. What are these?
P15,00:20:34,T4,First,Offline,"This is the external relations. They wanted something to the the automatic replies, you know support system for students."
P17,00:20:46,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P15,00:20:46,T4,First,Offline,There's so much risk in that.
P17,00:20:49,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah,."
P15,00:20:50,T4,First,Offline,And I guess for the University.
P17,00:20:54,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P15,00:20:54,T4,First,Offline,"So the greatest asset over there would be you know, you're doing something for your own University."
P17,00:20:59,T4,First,Offline,Plus it will definitely be successful.
P15,00:21:01,T4,First,Offline,Yeah. What keeps you up at night about this? For this nothing.
P17,00:21:06,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P15,00:21:06,T4,First,Offline,For this it will be.
P17,00:21:08,T4,First,Offline,Getting my degree.
P15,00:21:10,T4,First,Offline,"You just won't be you know, I want to do it. What's the last one?"
P17,00:21:19,T4,First,Offline,That's the OBASHI encrypted key.
P15,00:21:21,T4,First,Offline,"Okay. So for me, I think wait what was this one?"
P17,00:21:30,T4,First,Offline,We should start throwing out some.
P15,00:21:31,T4,First,Offline,Yes.
P17,00:21:32,T4,First,Offline,We've got way too may decide between.
P15,00:21:33,T4,First,Offline,This is the
P17,00:21:48,T4,First,Offline,What is that?
P15,00:21:49,T4,First,Offline,"The problem with this, It doesn't do anything special."
P17,00:22:02,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P15,00:22:03,T4,First,Offline,Everything must be some of the things over here do something really special.
P17,00:22:07,T4,First,Offline,Or re-targeted.
P15,00:22:09,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, I mean the information in this is really good. I think the client would be really informative the client would know what they're talking about."
P17,00:22:16,T4,First,Offline,Exactly.
P15,00:22:16,T4,First,Offline,But if it's not something that you would love to do.
P17,00:22:20,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P15,00:22:20,T4,First,Offline,I don't want to do it.
P17,00:22:21,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P15,00:22:21,T4,First,Offline,If you guys can fwwl.
P15,00:22:23,T4,First,Offline,"I'm all about helping you and helping you together. Like that's my number one thing in terms of Charities. But yeah, I am with you."
P15,00:22:31,T4,First,Offline,So are we hanging out the health-based first?
P17,00:22:34,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, let's keep close to those. This was definitely no."
P15,00:22:38,T4,First,Offline,"Yes, that's the separate pile."
P15,00:22:47,T4,First,Offline,Which one is that? oh chronic pain one.
P15,00:22:51,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P17,00:22:51,T4,First,Offline,"I keep that in because, you know the safe thing is safe bet, you know."
P15,00:22:57,T4,First,Offline,Safe bet.
P17,00:22:58,T4,First,Offline,"Plus It's an easy bit safe bet and it's something new. In Glasgow there is a safe bet and easy bet but it's you know, it's Glasgow."
P15,00:23:07,T4,First,Offline,Hope the University of Glasgow that have my campus so.
P17,00:23:11,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, so but no that is like helping some external parties not here in Glasgow. That's why I will be ingested to do with that."
P14,00:23:20,T4,First,Offline,What the app actually do?
P17,00:23:25,T4,First,Offline,Just distributed information.
P15,00:23:26,T4,First,Offline,"Understanding Chronic Pain, Pacing, Improving sleep, Dealing with negative and unhelpful thinking, Rebuilding confidence and self-esteem and Change and adaptation"
P17,00:23:34,T4,First,Offline,Basically everything.
P15,00:23:34,T4,First,Offline,Yeah self-help app basically.
P17,00:23:38,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah all they would offer you like on the like, you know face-to-face session, but you cannot expect those people."
P15,00:23:47,T4,First,Offline,Let's just keep that here. What do you want to improve next? I feel like this might be the way out.
P17,00:23:57,T4,First,Offline,What do you mean?
P15,00:23:57,T4,First,Offline,I mean in  neural network base. What do you think about this one?
P14,00:24:03,T4,First,Offline,Anyone.
P15,00:24:03,T4,First,Offline,This to propose for there's something.
P14,00:24:07,T4,First,Offline,Really?
P14,00:24:07,T4,First,Offline,There's a neural network based and satellite demo simulation.
P17,00:24:11,T4,First,Offline,I think with that we would have way too much trouble.
P15,00:24:14,T4,First,Offline,Yeah so much work.
P17,00:24:16,T4,First,Offline,"Okay, we already done it yet. Okay, I think about the University of Glasgow. What's your take on that? We're saving that for later, right?"
P15,00:24:34,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P17,00:24:35,T4,First,Offline,You can put that because I was saving.
P15,00:24:37,T4,First,Offline,It something like it's like I'm there.
P17,00:24:39,T4,First,Offline,What about the one in Glasgow?
P14,00:24:41,T4,First,Offline,He said this one is easy.
P17,00:24:42,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, it's pretty much the same the thing of that only differences that that's the third party that this is Glasgow like in terms of benefits and risks in terms of interesting. I find that a bit more interesting than this."
P15,00:24:56,T4,First,Offline,"What dose it say here some examples of the types of development. Okay, ultimately, we also have a scoping opportunity presented by the introduction of virtual assistant chatbot technology. Okay, that's never allow us to deal with inquiry application management more efficiently. We would be interested in finding out how such a thing might work. There is Simon see, you know, those chatbot that, you know, help us or just a chat at the bottom of the website."
P17,00:25:26,T4,First,Offline,"You really the one who wants the chat bot, put simply which interesting and  chat bot is manageable."
P15,00:25:32,T4,First,Offline,Yeah. It's very manageable
P17,00:25:32,T4,First,Offline,"But, I don't know."
P15,00:25:37,T4,First,Offline,"Okay, time to take this out."
P17,00:25:39,T4,First,Offline,The sports lab?
P15,00:25:39,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, I want to see what these guys know about what they're talking look like."
P17,00:25:44,T4,First,Offline,Only seem to know one of that
P14,00:25:44,T4,First,Offline,Oh The sports lab.
P15,00:25:47,T4,First,Offline,"The ball bouncing and identification. Ideally blah blah blah  within our field testing teams and for grounds staff to use to assess the ball rebound height of a sports surface, okay. The principle of this test involves releasing a ball from the specified and measuring the time between two bounces using an audio capture device the solution that you propose must comply to blah blah blah blah. I think what it does is pretty much what they want is to measure the time between the ball bouncing."
P17,00:26:25,T4,First,Offline,Two time sometimes yeah.
P15,00:26:25,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, because that's all math once once you know the time between the bouncers. That's all math after that. I don't want know why need to be cross-platform."
P17,00:26:36,T4,First,Offline,I think they will supply with the math.
P15,00:26:39,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P14,00:26:39,T4,First,Offline,"I mean if you have any questions about this one, they would be there that and we can talk about them about any of these questions."
P15,00:26:54,T4,First,Offline,A FIFA  workers intestines to do for football turf.
P17,00:26:58,T4,First,Offline,They seem legit.
P15,00:26:59,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, but also the ECB as well."
P17,00:27:03,T4,First,Offline,So we're saving that for later lead for challenge.
P15,00:27:07,T4,First,Offline,"All right, three left."
P17,00:27:09,T4,First,Offline,"Three left yeah. What is that? That's the youth thing, right?"
P15,00:27:17,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, young person engagement."
P17,00:27:22,T4,First,Offline,I'm  kind of kicking this out?
P15,00:27:26,T4,First,Offline,"Kicking it out, really?"
P17,00:27:27,T4,First,Offline,Yeah that's illegal
P15,00:27:27,T4,First,Offline,"You know it stays recently commission IT management software from Avanti and we would be interested in knowing if the software might be able to be used to provide effective, Waite they've commissioned software from somewhere and they want someone else to do what effect is support for alternative we all have also been scoping opportunity presenting bubble blah so you don't like that."
P17,00:27:51,T4,First,Offline,"No, not really."
P15,00:27:52,T4,First,Offline,"Not. Really. All right, pretty much. Everyone should like it."
P17,00:27:58,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, that means what we're the majority of the team so you know."
P15,00:28:05,T4,First,Offline,For Your Eyes Only project and the app development proposal. That's it to left now.
P17,00:28:13,T4,First,Offline,Definitely like this one.
P15,00:28:15,T4,First,Offline,I like this one that one as well.
P14,00:28:16,T4,First,Offline,Which is that one?
P17,00:28:17,T4,First,Offline,It is helping kids.
P15,00:28:19,T4,First,Offline,"They want to reach the youth and you know, help them realize their potential or something like that."
P14,00:28:28,T4,First,Offline,And it is app again.
P15,00:28:29,T4,First,Offline,it is app again.
P14,00:28:29,T4,First,Offline,Information?
P15,00:28:29,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P17,00:28:30,T4,First,Offline,It's really cool. I'm a feeling that and it's like in terms of my personal passions and goals in life. That is really what I would love to do. But you know like current from right career and entering point of view is not really what I want the right now.
P15,00:28:48,T4,First,Offline,"Proposed functions. Let's see the proposed launching the individual user profiles are signed and tracked events program calendar. Okay, a feedback form to what you just can tell us what they think it's okay individual users mailbox that that's fine. A media feed where users can receive an official trust promotional content a journey planner with which users can access passing train for the Little Bus and Train."
P14,00:29:10,T4,First,Offline,Yeah. This is where you to take these schedule.
P15,00:29:13,T4,First,Offline,Yeah simply schedule.
P17,00:29:15,T4,First,Offline,It's not that hard.
P15,00:29:16,T4,First,Offline,It's a lot of apps.
P17,00:29:19,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, I mean it is like an almond one thing sponsored by Prince's trust but you know, it's just kind of like."
P15,00:29:25,T4,First,Offline,Only if technically feasible.
P17,00:29:29,T4,First,Offline,It seems like really really.
P15,00:29:31,T4,First,Offline,That's essential areas are very simple. Yeah. It's just a social platform.
P14,00:29:37,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P17,00:29:37,T4,First,Offline,For kids.
P15,00:29:39,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P17,00:29:40,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, I mean that's why I'm like."
P15,00:29:44,T4,First,Offline,This one is.
P17,00:29:45,T4,First,Offline,That is like the biggest challenge my eyes. I'm not really excited about that.
P15,00:29:50,T4,First,Offline,I'm you're not ?
P17,00:29:52,T4,First,Offline,I'm not excited about it.
P15,00:29:53,T4,First,Offline,Okay.
P17,00:29:53,T4,First,Offline,"I'm definitely more sad about that one. I think about the kids and it sounds really weird, but like this this one is definitely more valuable, I would say."
P15,00:30:06,T4,First,Offline,So the sponsor here is pretty big trust. The sponsor here is a company.
P17,00:30:13,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P15,00:30:13,T4,First,Offline,And they think you know about what they're doing.
P17,00:30:19,T4,First,Offline,"Both. Yeah,."
P15,00:30:20,T4,First,Offline,These guys mostly.
P17,00:30:24,T4,First,Offline,I don't that project will be successful in the extended expected to be.
P15,00:30:30,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P17,00:30:30,T4,First,Offline,Because I think the expected to beyond
P15,00:30:32,T4,First,Offline,But their extent of reach. I don't think it's that much.
P17,00:30:38,T4,First,Offline,What I think they're expecting that the app will be more than just the prince's trust community that is already built. I think that will they will grow the community through that which I don't think it will happen. I think only the community might start using that not the other way around.
P15,00:30:52,T4,First,Offline,I know what the problem I have with this one.
P17,00:30:56,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P15,00:30:56,T4,First,Offline,Doesn't do anything new.
P17,00:30:57,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah. That's yeah, that's true, but it's by Prince's Trust."
P14,00:31:10,T4,First,Offline,The Prince's Trust is at something really really queen?
P17,00:31:14,T4,First,Offline,"I don't know but it's like a pretty big big big thing. I've heard as far as I know that I can help with kids who are being bullied and all that stuff. So, you know that I really support that but you know,."
P15,00:31:25,T4,First,Offline,"I think this is pretty good, but I don't know I can't decide between these two."
P17,00:31:29,T4,First,Offline,Me either. I mean can we not just keep all four?
P14,00:31:32,T4,First,Offline,I think we can I think all of them.
P15,00:31:35,T4,First,Offline,"We don't really have to decide today. Anyways,."
P17,00:31:37,T4,First,Offline,"We've also got two members that you know, could  help us out with that should we write these down quickly."
P14,00:31:42,T4,First,Offline,Yes.
P17,00:31:43,T4,First,Offline,"Or take photo, the 21st century."
P17,00:31:49,T4,First,Offline,"We just need the proposal so Sports lab, so I think this is the biggest challenge."
P15,00:31:57,T4,First,Offline,The this is a big step.
P17,00:31:59,T4,First,Offline,For the eyes only.
P15,00:32:00,T4,First,Offline,I like I like doing things where I have to learn something new.
P17,00:32:03,T4,First,Offline,"Well, you have to do that with the sports Labs as well for some."
P15,00:32:05,T4,First,Offline,"Yeah, you would."
P17,00:32:07,T4,First,Offline,"It's a different like new something new but from a different industry as well because like, you know, you're making a new device all together in a sense."
P15,00:32:49,T4,First,Offline,"Alright, so we have four pretty good proposals."
P17,00:32:57,T4,First,Offline,These are 3-3 plausible as well.
P15,00:33:07,T4,First,Offline,What we should do?
P17,00:33:19,T4,First,Offline,I think why you start.
P15,00:33:22,T4,First,Offline,Yeah. Just about to leave so I feel like what I'm going to do is
P17,00:33:35,T4,First,Offline,What's four?
P15,00:33:38,T4,First,Offline,Wait what was it the spelling of your name again? Okay I'm just going to write IV.
P14,00:33:45,T4,First,Offline,That's fine
P15,00:34:22,T4,First,Offline,Okay preferences. I'm going to be like that's my preferences
P14,00:35:11,T4,First,Offline,"This is the first and this the sound, pain"
P15,00:35:15,T4,First,Offline,"Pain one first. That's completely different. Okay, Matt?"
P17,00:35:27,T4,First,Offline,And okay.
P14,00:35:42,T4,First,Offline,Is this OBASHI one?
P17,00:35:43,T4,First,Offline,Yeah.
P14,00:35:45,T4,First,Offline,Okay
P17,00:35:45,T4,First,Offline,"I would acutely pain being first and sports being first, but young definitely second. That's like."
P15,00:35:53,T4,First,Offline,Young is good for me. Literally. All four of these is fine. Yeah. I can't I can't decide the only thing I like about the encryption is because we get to learn something really really cool something really new and we get to use different Technologies.
P17,00:36:07,T4,First,Offline,I'm just really concerned about the time constraint on that got the thing.
P15,00:36:12,T4,First,Offline,The thing that I'm concerned about is difficulty.
P14,00:36:13,T4,First,Offline,Yeah. were it is manageable for us to do and have time to do
P17,00:36:14,T4,First,Offline,It's definitely manageable. The question is how much time will it take? When is the deadline for this?
P14,00:36:29,T4,First,Offline,In March I think should be in end of April.
P15,00:36:38,T4,First,Offline,They have a good checkpoint in December as well. And then they have the final presentation and checkpoint  in March I think. It's a lot of time. I don't know let's let's find out what Olean have to say and we'll be done with it. Shall we tell we're done. Y
P17,00:36:58,T4,First,Offline,"eah. Yeah, so we need to run to the lecture"
P29,00:00:05,T7,Second,Offline,"Okay, how much do you want to stick to this plan or to socialize Wednesday?"
P31,00:00:09,T7,Second,Offline,I mean.
P32,00:00:12,T7,Second,Offline,Do you mean this plan this one here.
P29,00:00:13,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P32,00:00:13,T7,Second,Offline,Might as well.
P33,00:00:14,T7,Second,Offline,We're  here just want to help him guys
P31,00:00:15,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, we actually here for helping him"
P29,00:00:20,T7,Second,Offline,I know that's why I asked him. Can we just discuss what we got?
P33,00:00:23,T7,Second,Offline,"No, he actually he gave us."
P32,00:00:58,T7,Second,Offline,"I think he wants us to know this, mainly. So, we just gonna go through this and you ask him whatever you want to say"
P33,00:00:58,T7,Second,Offline,"Actually, I ask him before and I know what he wants. It's like this is for us to help us"
P32,00:00:58,T7,Second,Offline,So he just want us to talk?
P33,00:00:58,T7,Second,Offline,"Talk, exactly, this is what his research is about"
P29,00:00:58,T7,Second,Offline,I mean we have such nice voices.
P33,00:00:58,T7,Second,Offline,"Anyway, we're now discussing what technology we're going to use basically."
P31,00:01:00,T7,Second,Offline,Are we not doing this then ?
P32,00:01:00,T7,Second,Offline,No
P29,00:01:04,T7,Second,Offline,"Well, that's just because you don't know what to talk about I think."
P32,00:01:10,T7,Second,Offline,"Well technology-wise we got to get that done today. Yeah, because presentations on Wednesday and so it'd be really cool. If we could today we could decide and ultimately optimally get the presentation slides ready and then tomorrow we can practice."
P29,00:01:29,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, I think there was looking the next Monday. This looks different December. So that's only a couple days into the actual exam leave so I don't think."
P32,00:01:37,T7,Second,Offline,Sorry it's a presentation supposed to be what we're going to do between now and the fifth.
P29,00:01:42,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, so I don't think like I don't even try to say."
P31,00:01:45,T7,Second,Offline,"Oh, I'm sorry , I send you a link about it, I literally like collectively created all the data about what's going to happen."
P32,00:01:54,T7,Second,Offline,"Oh, that's cool that's cool. I have not time to I was going to do that over the weekend."
P29,00:01:58,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah. It's actually not too bad I think this is only half an hour everything kind of thing.
P31,00:02:02,T7,Second,Offline,"I can tell you the what it's called?  preparation for progression of inspiration. So what we have to do Wednesday during the meeting is progress demonstration and requirements Gathering so in this is where marked out of 20 on this, so we need to show clear demonstration of progress including completion of new features. Well at this I got that off the lighting projects from."
P29,00:02:25,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah
P31,00:02:26,T7,Second,Offline,Every I iteration was not just that completion of new features resolution of high-protein bugs issues that emerge that's not really doesn't concern concern this effective in the identification of new requirements agreement of priorities documentation of your priorities and team climate system. So we need to talk about the original goals of the iteration the state I like how the project is now if there's any missed objectives. If we accomplish more than you said we would we need to discuss issues that arose during their duration and then we need to do more requirements Gathering and I'm like agree on a realistic I mean amount of work and on the next like objectives.
P29,00:03:13,T7,Second,Offline,That's what you are saying. I don't think should be like it too much because majority of time we can spend in December is actually after the meeting.
P32,00:03:19,T7,Second,Offline,Will the presentation will be all do it together or we just have like one or two people who do the speaking?
P29,00:03:24,T7,Second,Offline,"Well, I still speaking to the court to some Wednesday. So saying, you know how that clients were seeing it before people to speak like it was not just one person, but the coaches were saying, you know, how ideally they want to cut just one person to speak. So it's coming basically two coaches rather than the client because they are the ones aren't marking you so I wasn't sure we could either maybe if we meeting a different person does all the talking or more to split up into two halves of what we've done and then what we will do I'm can always like and into people's can speak."
P29,00:03:52,T7,Second,Offline,I wouldn't mind do the presentation if somebody has to volunteer
P33,00:03:55,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah
P31,00:03:55,T7,Second,Offline,I think we should do like two people.
P33,00:03:58,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, we don't want and like last meeting."
P29,00:04:01,T7,Second,Offline,That's another thing. I wasn't sure if you do that don't like let's say one person starts off like what if you start off and then James you the Second half.
P31,00:04:09,T7,Second,Offline,I would like James starts off just that so..
P29,00:04:10,T7,Second,Offline,"Well, I was gonna say that next time James can do the first half unlike you can do the same house. And next time you can do first, Do you think you're happy with this?"
P31,00:04:19,T7,Second,Offline,I don't think that that the kind of thing we need to worry about right now.
P32,00:04:20,T7,Second,Offline,"NEWS- On Saturday, I was in a brithday party and a man just sopke to that girl which were doing the same project with."
P29,00:04:34,T7,Second,Offline,Tall one?
P32,00:04:36,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah the tall polish and she was saying that the decided I mean this is this is kind of concerning to me. Now. They say that they've decided that they're going to use like paid Library.
P33,00:04:50,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, that's what I'm saying."
P32,00:04:51,T7,Second,Offline,"And I'm like, I don't like what do they know?"
P33,00:04:55,T7,Second,Offline,I think like I've talked about the through the weekend. So the thing is a first of all if we are going to make some like free libraries really going to use some free libraries. That means that first we will do everything. We will do the learning and.
P31,00:05:16,T7,Second,Offline,It's going to be a learning curve regardless of reviews for your freedom.
P33,00:05:20,T7,Second,Offline,"The learning using maybe pythons python example is way much than learning SAS application, you know, the language in maybe low data flow or something for the closure."
P32,00:05:36,T7,Second,Offline,That's one of thing that they want to use
P33,00:05:39,T7,Second,Offline,Data flow? So I think.
P31,00:05:41,T7,Second,Offline,Do you want to use
P32,00:05:41,T7,Second,Offline,"No no, they want to use it. It's a fixed rate per like data request you make to it. So every time you make a request to dialogue flow, it's like."
P33,00:05:51,T7,Second,Offline,.000 25.
P32,00:05:53,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah
P29,00:05:53,T7,Second,Offline,The belly makes me feel better that our team can do better. It doesn't matter to me for a few weeks. I think looking at anything.
P31,00:06:03,T7,Second,Offline,"Creative thinking and Google bought it so it's well, that's what it's not AI That's free as well. That I mentioned."
P32,00:06:14,T7,Second,Offline,"It has loads of free stuff. Yeah. Well, I'm well I'm just concerned about is what is it that they've like discovered which they've come to the conclusion."
P33,00:06:22,T7,Second,Offline,I think they did not discover that the free.
P31,00:06:25,T7,Second,Offline,I think they were in the same Position. That's our best option.
P29,00:06:29,T7,Second,Offline,"I think the thing when you think about this like the school kids go to a professional and get it done. They're going to students, you know to get it cheaper and just to actually, you know, get it more handmade still like they could've just gone to things. I feel like you need to remember that."
P33,00:06:45,T7,Second,Offline,"Moreover is like I believe that even if we didn't with python for with python 100% our ground will be about somehow would be bug because there's nothing called perfect. Right? So if they made a problem using this technique use these apps Even though it's bugged but however, they got half of it. It's depend depending on the level flow you see. So if something bugged with data flow that is flow world, like take the responsibility for it. It's me, not him. It's 50/50."
P32,00:07:29,T7,Second,Offline,But it's like the cost of that thing could be really concerning because you were saying that it could cost him like what.
P33,00:07:35,T7,Second,Offline,They said 80 pounds beers maybe month.
P32,00:07:37,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, but it's."
P33,00:07:37,T7,Second,Offline,Month or so a year. I don't remember what it is.
P32,00:07:40,T7,Second,Offline,It's 80 pounds but it depends entirely on how much they to the thing is using the first place.
P33,00:07:44,T7,Second,Offline,Exactly.
P29,00:07:44,T7,Second,Offline,They want to scope of all.
P32,00:07:46,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah. I saw that you've a lot it ends up being like 80 pounds a month. It looks like most loads and loads of requests without 480 pounds a month. That's a thousand pounds a year just for QA system.
P33,00:07:57,T7,Second,Offline,Exactly.
P32,00:07:58,T7,Second,Offline,That's like that plate me crazy.
P33,00:07:59,T7,Second,Offline,I'm not sure it did he say 80 pounds per year or per month? I'm not sure yet. Even though here's don't.
P29,00:08:06,T7,Second,Offline,The numbers seems to be right.
P32,00:08:08,T7,Second,Offline,80 pounds a year for university it's noting.
P33,00:08:10,T7,Second,Offline,But still so they could learn the client could learn using this flow flow download easily. They could tell if teach them and eighty pounds per year and they can't control the data they have it's easier to them. That's why I thought about the weekend if they did that if they teach the client but I don't think they will.
P32,00:08:37,T7,Second,Offline,I think I think the best thing would be to just like deliberately set ourselves apart. And so if they're gonna if they're going to use the paid one that we should deliberately use the free stuff.
P31,00:08:47,T7,Second,Offline,I mean I don't want to use the paid stuff when there's clearly ways to do a good bond with free stuff.
P32,00:08:53,T7,Second,Offline,But do we know that yet?
P29,00:08:54,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P33,00:08:54,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah. Yeah.
P31,00:08:54,T7,Second,Offline,We saw we saw a lot of examples that worked.
P32,00:08:59,T7,Second,Offline,They're all really simple.
P29,00:09:00,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, you have ours doesn't sound too hard. No, it wasn't that complicated."
P32,00:09:03,T7,Second,Offline,It's very scalable. Like like a person could ask you a lot of different questions .
P33,00:09:08,T7,Second,Offline,Exactly
P31,00:09:11,T7,Second,Offline,I think she just like we hung with technology. We saw I think we should like use Python used language processing Library one that was mentioned.
P32,00:09:23,T7,Second,Offline,I think that's all like basically decided but I don't think anyone wants to do anything other than python.
P33,00:09:28,T7,Second,Offline,Just we want to support what they think about.
P31,00:09:33,T7,Second,Offline,The thing is I think we shouldn't Focus too much on what the other team is doing.
P32,00:09:38,T7,Second,Offline,We want to win this
P31,00:09:44,T7,Second,Offline,I'm winning anyway
P29,00:09:52,T7,Second,Offline,We're winning anyway
P33,00:09:52,T7,Second,Offline,How can you know you're winning anyway
P29,00:09:52,T7,Second,Offline,anyway Beacuse we're a better team
P31,00:09:52,T7,Second,Offline,"No, because we won the money anyway. So if I make something with at the end I'll be proud of it now."
P33,00:10:00,T7,Second,Offline,"Okay, cool."
P32,00:10:00,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, but you could be proud on also have like 50 pounds more and almost."
P31,00:10:04,T7,Second,Offline,I already have 50 pounds and more.
P29,00:10:06,T7,Second,Offline,And you will have 50 pounds more on top of that. Ditching?
P29,00:10:11,T7,Second,Offline,Okay. So why are we just talking about the other team right now?
P31,00:10:17,T7,Second,Offline,We should probably okay.
P33,00:10:18,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah I just need me to mention guys fund. I know you know this stuff but first three I found some PDF file which explain you the processing the files from Excel the data from the Excel and the uploaded to the.
P31,00:10:39,T7,Second,Offline,What you mean?
P32,00:10:40,T7,Second,Offline,In Python?
P29,00:10:41,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah just can identify Excel.
P31,00:10:44,T7,Second,Offline,What?
P33,00:10:44,T7,Second,Offline,I found a PDF explain how to extract the data promises.
P31,00:10:49,T7,Second,Offline,Well we can use Pandas as well.
P32,00:10:53,T7,Second,Offline,If you know how to use Pandas I'm going to leave that to you.
P31,00:10:54,T7,Second,Offline,"Like no, but pandas pandas is very well."
P29,00:10:57,T7,Second,Offline,Was it a data structure thing?
P31,00:10:59,T7,Second,Offline,It's a python library that allows you to parse data.
P32,00:11:02,T7,Second,Offline,"I have done Excel parsing, but only in Java. So I'm not familiar with python."
P31,00:11:06,T7,Second,Offline,Like I'm not used it before but I know my friends have an is really just really good to parse data.
P33,00:11:12,T7,Second,Offline,Just uploding the file?
P31,00:11:22,T7,Second,Offline,Sorry?
P31,00:11:22,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, I can just write in French is also exactly like a sign for the next iteration."
P33,00:11:28,T7,Second,Offline,"I think go just in case I think first we have to implement. The chat Bots and then we do. Okay. Yeah, well the sales and sure should we do the processing files that."
P32,00:11:43,T7,Second,Offline,We could we could split the code for that because the functions to get the shopbot to work. It will be the inspector from the functions to parse the Excel files.
P33,00:11:50,T7,Second,Offline,We could fill it or so and then we take the files just because it's like it's easier to do the chatbot both it's easier to do and when we see the client next time we will have Somethin to show.
P29,00:12:05,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah the thing I wasn't sure to see the next meeting to do for the fifth because it's only three weeks and we have other deadlines. It's just to say we will have a chat bot which you just say. Hello as he's a little back text. It gives you a piece of text image it gives you just a standard image click if that's me what we're in for.
P32,00:12:21,T7,Second,Offline,I can make that really easily.
P33,00:12:23,T7,Second,Offline,"This is easy. Yeah,."
P32,00:12:24,T7,Second,Offline,The first the first article which I sent was basically that in Python.
P29,00:12:28,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah. Yeah. Well that's was interpreting for something around like that call for another next. Just because we have like it's going to be the end of her mat lots of deadlines as long as you be too ambitious with what we in for next week systems programming the other one of their and is and although something else and the data fundamentals of different laws for that as well as just a weekly quizzes.
P32,00:12:54,T7,Second,Offline,So much course work.
P29,00:12:56,T7,Second,Offline,"But then after the fifth like yeah well, so that's why I feel like it will buckle up more."
P31,00:13:02,T7,Second,Offline,I feeel like what I'm looking for is very very fast library. And I'm gonna I'm gonna look like it's going to be deciding on Technologies to present like what our project What I was doing like what I saw the next step is going to be was like we should also show t on all those articles where they were like talking about classifying information.
P32,00:13:34,T7,Second,Offline,"Oh, yeah intention season yet."
P31,00:13:36,T7,Second,Offline,Make sure that we're going to do that like during the presentation.
P32,00:13:39,T7,Second,Offline,We should definitely put in that really cool graph did before.
P31,00:13:42,T7,Second,Offline,"What I did was like input classifying lecture question statement in question, like short courses and missions."
P32,00:13:52,T7,Second,Offline,Should that should we start with that? So we'll start out with.
P31,00:13:56,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah the classifying the information.
P32,00:13:58,T7,Second,Offline,"And how it like the logically like on a logical basis how it's supposed to work and stuff so they get into the get an idea. Yeah. Yeah, that's good. That's good."
P31,00:14:06,T7,Second,Offline,That's what I was like just like we tell them so we've been looking into like the basic principle of our chat bot going to work like like you needs so you need to like pass the language and then it's going to be class like the information that we've classified like depending on what it is and then then it's going to be analyzed and the proper response is going to be shown good
P32,00:14:28,T7,Second,Offline,Can you do presentations in Google Docs?
P31,00:14:30,T7,Second,Offline,Yes.
P29,00:14:31,T7,Second,Offline,"Well we can do. Like to do, you know how we have the word of mine comes to the PowerPoint thing also."
P33,00:14:40,T7,Second,Offline,"Okay, just in case how many slices do we need?"
P29,00:14:44,T7,Second,Offline,Any number because remember they also need to ask questions.
P32,00:14:50,T7,Second,Offline,Okay presentation and I think 10. I think first part should be what we've researched and what we discovered and then next part should be what we're planning on doing like the first person class.
P31,00:15:04,T7,Second,Offline,"Also going to be the you guys see this going to be like training data as well. So that's good that we have the need to dirty. Okay, but we need to train the box like this is this is also very related to what we're doing in need of fundamentals."
P32,00:15:18,T7,Second,Offline,Did you guys watch the Youtube video page?
P31,00:15:21,T7,Second,Offline,It's so cool.
P32,00:15:22,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, that's a real three blue one brown."
P31,00:15:24,T7,Second,Offline,I've been watching this since of the new or dings you mr.
P29,00:15:28,T7,Second,Offline,One of these me. Mr. Lee with ounce. How's the best video ever?
P31,00:15:33,T7,Second,Offline,"It was like a picnic look like an igloo and there was like thanks ants thanks,."
P29,00:15:42,T7,Second,Offline,But he left like to this earlier one another and all such a boring letter that makes it so much better.
P31,00:16:02,T7,Second,Offline,"Through yeah, we can maybe answer the question. Yeah, anyway, because I think it would be school."
P29,00:16:08,T7,Second,Offline,I don't think since that bad.
P31,00:16:09,T7,Second,Offline,"It's got to do the thing is like we decide on it. So yeah, this is how expensive the Chapel's going to be exactly good question is over like look because the most."
P29,00:16:20,T7,Second,Offline,Should we give example questions and this power meeting?
P31,00:16:24,T7,Second,Offline,Yes.
P33,00:16:25,T7,Second,Offline,So just in case I want to know what is our limitations in the chat box. So what exactly are we going to do the basic thing about the chat bot.
P32,00:16:34,T7,Second,Offline,The basic thing was.
P29,00:16:36,T7,Second,Offline,For the next iteration or altogether?
P33,00:16:39,T7,Second,Offline,In genreal.
P32,00:16:41,T7,Second,Offline,"Do you remember when you send the article about how chatbot works like on a logical level, you know, that really cool graph where we showed how when you go to the right that there's more sort of artificial intelligence bots and which like design their own answers."
P31,00:16:59,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah we need to put that on the slides
P32,00:17:02,T7,Second,Offline,"This more hard-coded ones in which the answers it gives other ones with the programmer programs for it. Well, what I said was we start by making a bar which is concentrates on the left. So the answers are what we give it, you know program it and that will work perfectly well and then after we get that working if we still have time then we can concentrate on stuff on the right side of the graph. So like automated answers and cool stuff like that."
P33,00:17:27,T7,Second,Offline,Okay. That's that's gonna be cool.
P32,00:17:28,T7,Second,Offline,Make sense makes sense?
P33,00:17:30,T7,Second,Offline,Make sense.
P32,00:17:31,T7,Second,Offline,"Okay, cool. So the next question do we have to work across teams? No,."
P29,00:17:34,T7,Second,Offline,I think it's best if we don't but I feel like a lot of is supposed to like it was I'm sure like me and Heather were seeing are also data coaches like every just don't talk to them. We will drift apart.
P32,00:17:45,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, well, I do like I do kind of like knowing what they're up to exactly."
P29,00:17:50,T7,Second,Offline,"We They know how to make fee worse about any thing like the oh no, they've already done this like."
P32,00:17:56,T7,Second,Offline,I mean  definitely did about the paid thing because I freaked well.
P33,00:17:58,T7,Second,Offline,"No no listen listen, I really thought it the thing is the data flow has many features that even if we put presented our app very well, we will not have for example, they have the voice chat."
P32,00:18:19,T7,Second,Offline,We don't really hate that you don't need that.
P33,00:18:23,T7,Second,Offline,"But yeah, they will feel okay."
P29,00:18:26,T7,Second,Offline,"But Muhammad, I really don't think we should we be too ambitious with it. Like."
P32,00:18:30,T7,Second,Offline,It's also bad to make a really bloated up but there you go.
P29,00:18:34,T7,Second,Offline,"You can do like yeah, I think so. I just want to ask how much does this cost like"
P32,00:18:45,T7,Second,Offline,"Supposed to be like a quick visit kind of thing. Yeah, not like."
P33,00:18:50,T7,Second,Offline,It's better to.
P29,00:18:51,T7,Second,Offline,"I think I'd be good for you watch video on that Genie thing that they sent us earlier. But some University was like a first assistant because my name of deadlines and what to do and not what I meant. No, that's nothing. Like I think the voicing it behind the are stuck for some like that where it's more like a lifestyle most. We're like, oh what that means do I have for most of."
P33,00:19:11,T7,Second,Offline,What kind of chat bot but we're going to create?
P32,00:19:23,T7,Second,Offline,It's a Q&A bot. We'll just ask you questions.
P33,00:19:29,T7,Second,Offline,Mean Machine learning using the machine.
P32,00:19:31,T7,Second,Offline,No the Q&A bot is which requires the least machine learning because most of the questions already predicted and so your program would give the answers.
P33,00:19:40,T7,Second,Offline,Okay.
P32,00:19:41,T7,Second,Offline,Have we decided to use a new technology to us? If so is concerning? Not really just libraries.
P29,00:19:48,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P31,00:19:49,T7,Second,Offline,"Just the language, like the concepts of processing language is new to."
P29,00:19:54,T7,Second,Offline,I don't think any of us really concerning we will have learned obviously but what to learn.
P32,00:19:58,T7,Second,Offline,I'm not actually sure how much we have to learn about the language processing because it seems like the libraries from them really well for my look to the example code.
P29,00:20:05,T7,Second,Offline,Do you know like maybe four examples of how they work?
P32,00:20:09,T7,Second,Offline,No.
P33,00:20:10,T7,Second,Offline,Which code do you mean?
P29,00:20:12,T7,Second,Offline,"Because the examples I saw seemed very like talkative like their social like, oh I went to Portugal and so a pinata something like that."
P32,00:20:21,T7,Second,Offline,I think definitely one of us should probably figure out how the language was the most.
P29,00:20:25,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P32,00:20:25,T7,Second,Offline,I'm not sure what to watch that. We should really know in detail. How are we finding a behavior of our customers? They're very nice
P29,00:20:33,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, they are good."
P32,00:20:35,T7,Second,Offline,I know we've only had like one too many things.
P29,00:20:38,T7,Second,Offline,It seems like a lot like this like a gang of them. There's more of them than us.
P32,00:20:43,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, they feel like an interrogation when we went."
P29,00:20:46,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah. Yeah, especially for you lose for sure with so many that last meeting."
P32,00:20:50,T7,Second,Offline,Are we finding our coaches useful?
P29,00:20:55,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah. They're really good. Yeah, I think give us lots of tips."
P31,00:20:59,T7,Second,Offline,Not even just like for employment related question like Union related questions things.
P32,00:21:07,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P31,00:21:08,T7,Second,Offline,"We get to as well, which is nice."
P32,00:21:11,T7,Second,Offline,I think I'd like to do that actually to be a coach because it's easier.
P31,00:21:14,T7,Second,Offline,Do you want to do the then software engineering.
P32,00:21:16,T7,Second,Offline,Do I have to do that?
P31,00:21:18,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah you do
P32,00:21:18,T7,Second,Offline,I wouldn't mind actually because I do like systems programming.
P31,00:21:22,T7,Second,Offline,It's not systems programming to do this. It's just basically a continuation of professional software.
P32,00:21:27,T7,Second,Offline,"Okay. Alright, that was okay. I guess."
P31,00:21:30,T7,Second,Offline,I think it's just like basically you learn about a job.
P32,00:21:33,T7,Second,Offline,"Okay, but at least I get to do the coach thing, which is easy credits."
P29,00:21:37,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah. Yeah. I think that's what's missing about.
P32,00:21:40,T7,Second,Offline,What do they do? They just come to the class?
P31,00:21:45,T7,Second,Offline,"No, they need to wrtite reports and stuff."
P32,00:21:49,T7,Second,Offline,It's easy to write a report is hard to like do it fucking itches exercise.
P29,00:21:53,T7,Second,Offline,You can probably haven't looked at the other fourth your course of answer. Some of them were really.
P32,00:21:57,T7,Second,Offline,I just am always saying like the third year is is harder for coursework and forth year.
P29,00:22:02,T7,Second,Offline,You don't specialize.
P33,00:22:04,T7,Second,Offline,Actually they say it's the same.
P31,00:22:06,T7,Second,Offline,I think you should just get used to but to be fair. I like it. I think it's going to be less work.
P32,00:22:18,T7,Second,Offline,I hope hope seemed lost.
P31,00:22:20,T7,Second,Offline,It is going to be more personal work. So it's going to be like more like.
P29,00:22:26,T7,Second,Offline,Easier to organize.
P31,00:22:29,T7,Second,Offline,To blame if you feel.
P29,00:22:30,T7,Second,Offline,"But I don't like that though. I can kind of the Deltas with myself thinking. Oh, well, I didn't really contribute much Wednesday sounds no and so on ."
P32,00:22:38,T7,Second,Offline,Have we changed the structure of our team. They were team structures is I think it's too early to decide what he is going to do.
P31,00:22:45,T7,Second,Offline,I think he is going to use this right now.
P32,00:22:48,T7,Second,Offline,It's kind of rude how a few people showed up.
P29,00:22:57,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah probably a shame because they got like the reward which are worth it in the end.
P32,00:23:01,T7,Second,Offline,We did not get some aids tnis time did we?
P29,00:23:01,T7,Second,Offline,The thing with coffee.
P32,00:23:06,T7,Second,Offline,"The coffe seems good. I don't drink coffe, but it was still nice."
P31,00:23:14,T7,Second,Offline,"It wasn't coffe though, it was more tea"
P29,00:23:16,T7,Second,Offline,So you should be split by 2 then each meeting by two people.
P33,00:23:23,T7,Second,Offline,I wanted to say about the presentation we could like make two people to do the presentation. But if someone knows about an area if they ask and someone knows about the idea they asked.
P31,00:23:36,T7,Second,Offline,I mean we kind of know that the meetings going to look meeting is going to be in the labs. So it's not going to be it's not going to be very focused.
P29,00:23:46,T7,Second,Offline,"Well, one of the things we'll coaches do not like is when people just like run like just keep talking around the place. I think like if we just tried to do ten minutes of what we've done. Ten Minutes of what we will do then ten minutes of questions. When asked questions yet the ask one thing that they don't think it should go like that."
P32,00:24:02,T7,Second,Offline,Tim give some good advice on that. He said that the presentation ideally should talk more about what you're planning on doing then what and a lot of people are they waste too much time talking about what they've done and so they don't talk much about what they're going to do until it makes them look bad but because it doesn't seem like they've planned in advanced. Yeah. So I think maybe it should be like a third talk about what we've done and then try to stretch the rest of it to talk about.
P29,00:24:27,T7,Second,Offline,We still time for questions and the questions will be about the future.
P32,00:24:30,T7,Second,Offline,I'll be playing so half an hour right questions are included in a half hour.
P29,00:24:36,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P32,00:24:36,T7,Second,Offline,Okay. So seven minutes talk about we've done.
P29,00:24:41,T7,Second,Offline,You're very precise.
P32,00:24:44,T7,Second,Offline,Yes.
P33,00:24:45,T7,Second,Offline,Okay to be that.
P29,00:24:53,T7,Second,Offline,"Okay, yeah."
P32,00:24:59,T7,Second,Offline,Seven minutes because 20/3 because of trying to get into thirds again.
P31,00:25:11,T7,Second,Offline,"So not focus on what we're going to do, but we have to say like what?"
P29,00:25:16,T7,Second,Offline,"I think it's more important to this meeting because we actually haven't done anything really before so we need to get them on board at the star and then, you know talk about the future and stuff."
P32,00:25:29,T7,Second,Offline,Are we gonna see the other teams?
P29,00:25:30,T7,Second,Offline,I don't think I don't think I think the coaches said you don't see them. But this thing I think the people just in the same place.
P31,00:25:40,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P32,00:25:40,T7,Second,Offline,But you might actually see the other teams which is not a big advantage.
P31,00:25:44,T7,Second,Offline,What we also need to do is after the presentation right away. We need to conduct a retrospective.
P29,00:25:48,T7,Second,Offline,Our cooaches also have to that though.
P32,00:25:49,T7,Second,Offline,Why is that?
P29,00:25:52,T7,Second,Offline,It's just seeing how we were and what do we feel.
P32,00:25:57,T7,Second,Offline,I don't know if he'll even though I because I just Ctrl F most of the answers.
P31,00:26:07,T7,Second,Offline,What did you do that we like to do not like.
P29,00:26:13,T7,Second,Offline,So they're anonymously.
P31,00:26:16,T7,Second,Offline,"Iteration getting better and it's like this light Longs for like do something. Well, like there's one that's like Facebook reactions like angry reaction that stuff like that. But I put some information on that in the get in the wiki they have all sent to you that no one has bothered looking at."
P29,00:26:40,T7,Second,Offline,I know I looked it.
P31,00:26:41,T7,Second,Offline,A bit.
P29,00:26:42,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah
P32,00:26:44,T7,Second,Offline,I totally would have but I literally have no time
P31,00:26:51,T7,Second,Offline,I think it's going to happen getting over it though.
P32,00:26:53,T7,Second,Offline,I'll read it today. Decided. Are we done here though.
P32,00:27:03,T7,Second,Offline,"Well, should we not just decide on the presentation now anyway."
P32,00:27:05,T7,Second,Offline,"Okay, cool. So decide what first story."
P31,00:27:10,T7,Second,Offline,Like what how are we going to start?
P32,00:27:12,T7,Second,Offline,"Well, I thought that was a plan."
P31,00:27:15,T7,Second,Offline,So so our goal for the ages through you just say I'll go for the integration was in this entire region.
P29,00:27:20,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, let's look like the meeting notes."
P32,00:27:22,T7,Second,Offline,And yeah the goal for the restoration would go over all the stuff that we've learned about having a chat bot of so they get.
P29,00:27:28,T7,Second,Offline,"And remember to we need to what we didn't or things where we're going. We're going we're not getting paid thing because of us, they're like us, you know, especially because other teams doing it more important to stress."
P32,00:27:37,T7,Second,Offline,"Making the other teams look bad, good idea."
P29,00:27:38,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, but we'll see the other team."
P31,00:27:41,T7,Second,Offline,"No, we probably not commanding other teams"
P29,00:27:44,T7,Second,Offline,We're not doing paid stuff because we're not idiots.
P32,00:27:47,T7,Second,Offline,We you are defending Leonore?
P33,00:27:48,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P29,00:27:56,T7,Second,Offline,"Oh is that your freind in the other team. No, but we need to see why we didn't decide on other things. Remember."
P31,00:27:58,T7,Second,Offline,"Apparently we should not focus too much on what we actually did it, but more like a lot we actually going to do so, we should keep that concisely the whole this is what we get."
P33,00:28:08,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P29,00:28:08,T7,Second,Offline,We have but I don't think to contains because it's like the first meeting.
P32,00:28:11,T7,Second,Offline,Let's choose first who's going to do these two parts of the presentation. So I need an answer for either.
P29,00:28:16,T7,Second,Offline,Same.
P32,00:28:16,T7,Second,Offline,"Leo, what do you want to do? Do you want to flip the coin or something?"
P29,00:28:25,T7,Second,Offline,"No, you two can do this one"
P32,00:28:25,T7,Second,Offline,I think I perfer to do the first
P31,00:28:25,T7,Second,Offline,I think I can do the secound part.
P32,00:28:25,T7,Second,Offline,"So me and Leo we're going to do the okay, but that narrows it down unless you wanted to do do."
P33,00:28:36,T7,Second,Offline,Of course.
P31,00:28:37,T7,Second,Offline,"No, do you want to?"
P33,00:28:39,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P32,00:28:40,T7,Second,Offline,So you want you want to do this one?
P33,00:28:42,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah true, it's ok"
P32,00:28:42,T7,Second,Offline,Do you want to do the First or second part?
P33,00:28:45,T7,Second,Offline,Really It's okay with me.
P32,00:28:46,T7,Second,Offline,"Oh, so you don't reaaly want to do it."
P33,00:28:48,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, I want to do it."
P31,00:28:50,T7,Second,Offline,It's not clear. It's never clear what you want.
P32,00:28:56,T7,Second,Offline,Like you can do it made me like as like to do the first part of the presentation.
P31,00:29:01,T7,Second,Offline,So you feel confident enough in doing the second part and talking about technology we're going to use.
P33,00:29:06,T7,Second,Offline,I think yeah because it shows a lot and now we clear we know everything is very clean.
P29,00:29:12,T7,Second,Offline,And we'll have slides.
P33,00:29:13,T7,Second,Offline,"But still you know, we have to put the presentation together because."
P32,00:29:18,T7,Second,Offline,I feel like it might be easier to decide who's going to do it first so that. Way.
P29,00:29:23,T7,Second,Offline,Get familiar with it.
P32,00:29:25,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, exactly."
P32,00:29:27,T7,Second,Offline,So would you rather do the second part of this presentation instead of lie?
P33,00:29:33,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P32,00:29:35,T7,Second,Offline,Really? Sure.
P33,00:29:37,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P31,00:29:38,T7,Second,Offline,That's the hard part.
P33,00:29:40,T7,Second,Offline,I know but that's okay.
P32,00:29:43,T7,Second,Offline,Sure.
P33,00:29:44,T7,Second,Offline,Come on guys
P29,00:29:44,T7,Second,Offline,it's only like 10% of your final grade. Also.
P32,00:29:47,T7,Second,Offline,Really?
P29,00:29:48,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P32,00:29:48,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah. Okay cool. So I guess it's time you guys go to the next one? Yeah, we'll practice it."
P29,00:29:57,T7,Second,Offline,"I think what would you do as an entrant is you know, when they get those giant circular things like sandpaper and we'll jump through it."
P31,00:30:05,T7,Second,Offline,No.
P29,00:30:05,T7,Second,Offline,"I'm like team bought runner team for Runner. Who are we were, but Runner I will just like, oh, yeah the other people in the love like a cheer like pom-poms."
P32,00:30:14,T7,Second,Offline,And would let students to dance.
P29,00:30:17,T7,Second,Offline,You mean Lieo can do all you talk about.
P31,00:30:19,T7,Second,Offline,Let's do the robot then
P29,00:30:23,T7,Second,Offline,See one thing wrong with that idea.
P33,00:30:32,T7,Second,Offline,The whole idea is wrong man.
P32,00:30:35,T7,Second,Offline,Have anyone done theatre?
P29,00:30:36,T7,Second,Offline,"I feel you were made for theatre. I yeah, I did not have a good experience with drama school.  My Scottish accent was Russian."
P32,00:30:46,T7,Second,Offline,Really? I think you should not let that put you down.
P29,00:30:49,T7,Second,Offline,I see lots of other drunks you're hated me.
P32,00:30:53,T7,Second,Offline,Because you were so good.
P29,00:30:56,T7,Second,Offline,No Because I interrupted her.
P32,00:31:07,T7,Second,Offline,First part is what we've done and I'll talk about what we've learned about how a chatbot should be should be sort of designed on a logical basis and then I'll look at all of the other libraries or talk about how he decided to use the free the free choices and will we should we should decide after.
P29,00:31:25,T7,Second,Offline,Should we see that we haven't ruled out maybe later on if we have do you want to come I like a small library or something.
P29,00:31:32,T7,Second,Offline,No don't touch it.
P29,00:31:34,T7,Second,Offline,"We'll the think he's late for all I'm like, well actually we did by the small thing because you don't think it'd be fair or just it was."
P31,00:31:39,T7,Second,Offline,We just do it one iteration a time.
P32,00:31:41,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah. Yeah.
P29,00:31:42,T7,Second,Offline,What does not spend anything in like February like.
P32,00:31:46,T7,Second,Offline,It's no big deal.
P31,00:31:46,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah. That's kind of thing you mentioned in the meetings, it's like the kind of issue."
P32,00:31:57,T7,Second,Offline,I think if I cover all the libraries quickly to I mean they don't really what care that much.
P29,00:32:03,T7,Second,Offline,No they're not very big.
P32,00:32:04,T7,Second,Offline,And I guess it's only gonna be seven minutes or something. I guess you're probably say something else. But what else could be done?
P31,00:32:10,T7,Second,Offline,"We know what, we know what technology to classify we're going to talk about how we're going to classify the information. That's the second part."
P32,00:32:18,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, I think that's hard."
P33,00:32:20,T7,Second,Offline,We have to talk about the paid.
P32,00:32:21,T7,Second,Offline,"No. No, we don't know. We don't know."
P29,00:32:25,T7,Second,Offline,But I'll mention why we didn't do okay.
P32,00:32:31,T7,Second,Offline,"Okay. Okay. Yeah, so we'll mention how we decided that it would be best - okay."
P29,00:32:36,T7,Second,Offline,I think that's the coach's think that's one of the things you get marked on. It's like seeing like why you didn't.
P32,00:32:41,T7,Second,Offline,"Okay cool. Well, I think I should basically fill up the amount of time which I would have to do."
P29,00:32:45,T7,Second,Offline,So so it's hard to judge talking time.
P32,00:32:48,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P32,00:32:50,T7,Second,Offline,"No, I don't know I have done a few presentations. I think at this point I can kind of gauge how long some things will take. So that's the basic outline for the first part. So when we've got a lot of time to take up in the next part, we will talk over planning on doing."
P29,00:33:05,T7,Second,Offline,I think we should just have a very basic chatbot.
P32,00:33:08,T7,Second,Offline,Definitely.
P29,00:33:09,T7,Second,Offline,"Like do I actually really talk about a data that much and just have it like so you see like take an image and it just gives you an image like, you know, there was example article."
P31,00:33:19,T7,Second,Offline,Is that for Wednesday?
P29,00:33:20,T7,Second,Offline,No for the next iteration.
P32,00:33:22,T7,Second,Offline,Basic prototype
P29,00:33:22,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, just to see like this is how it would work but there's actually work with any data source or"
P32,00:33:31,T7,Second,Offline,"I mean, it's just a ball. I guess. I don't know like a wireframe on the the presentation."
P29,00:33:34,T7,Second,Offline,That's why I wasn't sure.
P31,00:33:35,T7,Second,Offline,I saw the other team doing my friends.
P32,00:33:39,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, because I guess we will be designing the actual chat."
P31,00:33:42,T7,Second,Offline,Should we mentioned are you a genuine?
P32,00:33:43,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah definitely, ask them if they like it."
P31,00:33:48,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah
P32,00:33:48,T7,Second,Offline,We don't have to quote that.
P29,00:33:50,T7,Second,Offline,I don't lose you ask them if they like. I think we should like next meeting then say like this is a personality we're going forward was downstairs and then they can see.
P31,00:34:03,T7,Second,Offline,So I think we should ask.
P32,00:34:04,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, maybe get to know. What do you what do you have against it?"
P29,00:34:10,T7,Second,Offline,It's such a winnie named.
P33,00:34:10,T7,Second,Offline,Sorry guys will stand with him.
P32,00:34:17,T7,Second,Offline,"It's a cute name, you genie."
P33,00:34:17,T7,Second,Offline,"Sorry, I will stand with him."
P32,00:34:18,T7,Second,Offline,It's gonna look really cute with the icon. We got the you g like highlighted in the name.
P31,00:34:23,T7,Second,Offline,What are we talking about. What do you have in mind?
P32,00:34:26,T7,Second,Offline,"Well, I mean it's going to have like when you open the chat is obviously going to be you genie in the top left to see that you're speaking."
P29,00:34:34,T7,Second,Offline,But remember they still want to quit professional.
P31,00:34:36,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah. No, they said to keep it to the tone of the brand."
P29,00:34:40,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah. It's any part of the round.
P31,00:34:44,T7,Second,Offline,Why does that bother you? Why does enie bother you?
P32,00:34:47,T7,Second,Offline,Well you could vote Eugene?
P29,00:34:50,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, I feel like that's a big difference because."
P32,00:34:51,T7,Second,Offline,It's basically the same.
P29,00:34:54,T7,Second,Offline,But I don't like either but there's a big difference between them still.
P31,00:34:57,T7,Second,Offline,Why?
P32,00:34:57,T7,Second,Offline,So would you would you rather do.
P31,00:34:59,T7,Second,Offline,Because  Genie says genie? Like a smart person a genie
P32,00:35:02,T7,Second,Offline,"No, a genie like the thing in the bottle"
P31,00:35:02,T7,Second,Offline,"But in French, that means a person is smart"
P32,00:35:02,T7,Second,Offline,None of us speak french
P32,00:35:31,T7,Second,Offline,"Oh, I thought you guys were that because oh my God, it's small."
P29,00:35:34,T7,Second,Offline,Oh like genius.
P31,00:35:35,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, like genius."
P33,00:35:36,T7,Second,Offline,Okay.
P31,00:35:37,T7,Second,Offline,You genie.
P29,00:35:38,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, I didn't know that James."
P32,00:35:40,T7,Second,Offline,Sorry.
P31,00:35:40,T7,Second,Offline,Like a genius capable of granting wishes when summons which is basically what a bud dose.
P33,00:35:46,T7,Second,Offline,Okay.
P29,00:35:50,T7,Second,Offline,That's my wife. Come back to me. No.
P32,00:35:53,T7,Second,Offline,That's interesting. Actually. I'm actually thought of it that way.
P31,00:35:56,T7,Second,Offline,I thought genie is in English. Like try everyone would understand energy as genius.
P32,00:36:03,T7,Second,Offline,No you genie our names.
P31,00:36:07,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P32,00:36:08,T7,Second,Offline,"And so when I hear you genie, I just think of the name of the person not the actually do you think so."
P31,00:36:14,T7,Second,Offline,Me too but in the context of we are trying to make a pun. I was thinking about genie I thought it was meant as a genius
P32,00:36:24,T7,Second,Offline,I'm not really open-minded.
P29,00:36:27,T7,Second,Offline,"No, I got a genie part but like I'm not fully against it and just think I think we should think about"
P29,00:36:31,T7,Second,Offline,it a little longer and then give them are more like fight like thought through solution.
P32,00:36:34,T7,Second,Offline,Like a list of names.
P31,00:36:38,T7,Second,Offline,Your list of names if you read against genie.
P32,00:36:41,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P29,00:36:42,T7,Second,Offline,"I'm not really against genie. I just think we should have a more finalised like like give them a like. Oh, this is the kind of thing. We're think I'm just thinking like, oh, we thought abut genie"
P32,00:36:51,T7,Second,Offline,This is what I'm saying. So we should come up with a list of names and then we just let them pick.
P29,00:36:55,T7,Second,Offline,"No, what if they pick a bad one?"
P32,00:36:57,T7,Second,Offline,What?
P31,00:36:59,T7,Second,Offline,It's not our choice.
P33,00:36:59,T7,Second,Offline,Why?
P29,00:37:00,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, it's our choice."
P31,00:37:02,T7,Second,Offline,No.
P33,00:37:02,T7,Second,Offline,No
P29,00:37:03,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P32,00:37:05,T7,Second,Offline,"No, can we give it a bad name? It's their ball."
P29,00:37:08,T7,Second,Offline,"No, we can get say I think we should say this is what we want to do and they can say or do you want to change anything and is it actually heat that change that I think we should be more assertive and see what we do."
P33,00:37:20,T7,Second,Offline,I would say give them simple name.
P31,00:37:26,T7,Second,Offline,We just have to actually do the presentation.
P32,00:37:27,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah. Anyway, we were talking about what we're going to do in the second part and."
P31,00:37:32,T7,Second,Offline,"Talk about what we're going to do. So,."
P29,00:37:37,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, I think it's just have a basic like, you know that article was talking about gonna make you a see Emma just shows you how much easier."
P32,00:37:44,T7,Second,Offline,Why friend? Yeah.
P29,00:37:46,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah an example question.
P29,00:37:50,T7,Second,Offline,"Are we going to to talk about Pandas which is a very fast by the library to like parse the data. Yeah, I would show the information model we're going to use and how we're going to use a language processing library for that and like how that's going to like about this color sponsor."
P32,00:38:05,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah. Okay, cool."
P33,00:38:07,T7,Second,Offline,Excuse me. That's that the pond Library needs for all the Excel sheets to be in one form?
P31,00:38:18,T7,Second,Offline,What do you mean one Form?
P32,00:38:19,T7,Second,Offline,All in one file?
P33,00:38:22,T7,Second,Offline,"No, no one form. Like they don't if it's like, for example, there's a file associate with three columns and other Associated four columns and say."
P29,00:38:34,T7,Second,Offline,No they don't need to be in the same format.
P31,00:38:37,T7,Second,Offline,Again I need to look into thing but it's a very powerful very fast.
P29,00:38:43,T7,Second,Offline,"We don't know what the columns will be. So we need to like we can say looked in the first five columns and get the names column 2 will be project because like we said, we don't actually know that yet."
P32,00:38:53,T7,Second,Offline,If the library feel light on the Excel always being of a specific format then nobody would use the library. It has to be very flexible do so. This isn't something you need to worry about really.
P33,00:39:04,T7,Second,Offline,Okay
P29,00:39:04,T7,Second,Offline,And this is not what I was just going over because they all we came across a problem. So where is where I started doing.
P33,00:39:11,T7,Second,Offline,"Just in case if they after we've done the program and we already populated the data, how can they change it."
P29,00:39:19,T7,Second,Offline,"Just as in if I'll just put it in a file. So yeah, that's about you know Computing bachelor degree. This is why I don't date or not. They can just add them data. Is he talking about coming back."
P33,00:39:37,T7,Second,Offline,It's not like that.
P32,00:39:38,T7,Second,Offline,This is something that we thought we just yet.
P33,00:39:44,T7,Second,Offline,So you just do it them. Throw it. Okay.
P29,00:39:47,T7,Second,Offline,We're only focusing on what we've done and what will they tell a fifth of December.
P31,00:39:51,T7,Second,Offline,Basically when we need to answer in the rotation if this and that's it. This is on gitlab as I have mentioned.
P32,00:40:02,T7,Second,Offline,Does anyone want to go to the lab and do this?
P31,00:40:03,T7,Second,Offline,"I'm going to allow many with any Community, but I'm going to lab anywhere but it's probably close to a school systems question, rather."
P32,00:40:11,T7,Second,Offline,I'm gonna go to the club to have lunch and one narrow the list.
P31,00:40:17,T7,Second,Offline,And I you sent a link to Google slides off that I wrote.
P32,00:40:20,T7,Second,Offline,Cool. Cool. I'll read all the technology things so we can pick the libraries that will use.
P33,00:40:27,T7,Second,Offline,So basically we're going to the library to do that presentation.
P29,00:40:35,T7,Second,Offline,"No, I'll be in the third year lab"
P32,00:40:37,T7,Second,Offline,I mean we can do it wherever you want.
P29,00:40:38,T7,Second,Offline,I don't think are firstly you should be too much of a look at the computer though. Like to be mainly just talking and just like slides to add to us not always the case.  We're gonna get some presentations which are like like that's just something like that.
P32,00:40:58,T7,Second,Offline,That's a bad presentation.
P29,00:40:59,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah,."
P32,00:41:00,T7,Second,Offline,The point of the presentation is that it's just very short bullet points- and then it's mostly the talking which explains everything.
P32,00:41:06,T7,Second,Offline,Or just Artisan hands of like Melissa leads kind of thing.
P32,00:41:11,T7,Second,Offline,How many presentations you have done?
P29,00:41:14,T7,Second,Offline,I don't know.
P32,00:41:14,T7,Second,Offline,The when are we doing presentation that the slice is supposed to be the absolute minimum amount of information and it's the talk is the speaker.
P29,00:41:22,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, that's what I am saying."
P32,00:41:23,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, so don't have to worry about like how much information on the slides because it's going to be very very small very small. I'm information and there's just a speaker who just like there's already explained."
P29,00:41:34,T7,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P32,00:41:34,T7,Second,Offline,Awesome. So we are done?
P29,00:41:38,T7,Second,Offline,You think?
P31,00:41:39,T7,Second,Offline,"I mean, it's has been here an hour now were so."
P33,00:41:41,T7,Second,Offline,Far enough.
P29,00:41:42,T7,Second,Offline,Are we meeting tomorrow?
P32,00:41:46,T7,Second,Offline,Yes.
P29,00:41:46,T7,Second,Offline,I have a lab at 10. I'm going to be between eleven and two.
P33,00:41:56,T7,Second,Offline,I'm cool after one o'clock two o'clock.
P32,00:41:59,T7,Second,Offline,Two o'clock is the lecture
P33,00:42:05,T7,Second,Offline,I have something to do a clock So.
P32,00:42:08,T7,Second,Offline,I just say I'm free before too.
P29,00:42:10,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, I'm going between 11:00 and 2:00."
P32,00:42:12,T7,Second,Offline,"Okay, Leo."
P31,00:42:14,T7,Second,Offline,What's my time.
P32,00:42:16,T7,Second,Offline,Before too?
P33,00:42:17,T7,Second,Offline,I mean let's say from 12 was from 10 to 12  and that's it. Sorry.
P32,00:42:25,T7,Second,Offline,I'll have to meet at 11:00.
P33,00:42:27,T7,Second,Offline,Okay.
P31,00:42:27,T7,Second,Offline,"Yeah, keep it to one hour so I can ask as many questions."
P32,00:42:33,T7,Second,Offline,"Okay, so it'll have to be like 11. You have to really quickly."
P29,00:42:41,T7,Second,Offline,You can always go back to lab after.
P33,00:42:43,T7,Second,Offline,I have to go somewhere.
P25,00:00:30,T6,Second,Offline,Do you have to work across teams?
P26,00:00:32,T6,Second,Offline,"Not really, but."
P25,00:00:36,T6,Second,Offline,Just the organizers video go.
P26,00:00:37,T6,Second,Offline,"Yeah, exactly."
P25,00:00:41,T6,Second,Offline,Have we decided to use a new technology new to us? Sql databases.
P26,00:00:46,T6,Second,Offline,Yeah. No I think this like it's not concerning as well for our use will be just.
P25,00:00:56,T6,Second,Offline,I think it will be easier in SQL databases. These are particular schema.
P26,00:00:59,T6,Second,Offline,"Yeah. Yeah, it's like to like Jason right verse."
P27,00:01:04,T6,Second,Offline,"Yes, it's just Jason."
P25,00:01:06,T6,Second,Offline,"How you find the behavior of our customers? He is quite nice, I guss."
P26,00:01:10,T6,Second,Offline,"Yeah, I think yeah, he's really good. I mean it's always like different communication. Sorry?"
P25,00:01:19,T6,Second,Offline,Excuse get rid of communication.
P26,00:01:21,T6,Second,Offline,I'm glad your customers are actually software engineer.
P27,00:01:23,T6,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P25,00:01:23,T6,Second,Offline,As I see if we had any chronic pain guy who does nothing try to get technical thing often what we do?
P28,00:01:30,T6,Second,Offline,"Yeah, he's very like practical. I mean, you know, he knows what he wants here. He's very related to software because he is."
P25,00:01:39,T6,Second,Offline,How are you finding your coach?.
P27,00:01:51,T6,Second,Offline,I didn't enough instructions.
P25,00:01:54,T6,Second,Offline,"Have we changed the structure of the group is if so, why? No"
P26,00:01:59,T6,Second,Offline,"like in terms of how we have like a see if I was a test manager, which you could change to change your task manager somewhere."
P27,00:02:09,T6,Second,Offline,What else?
P28,00:02:18,T6,Second,Offline,"Yeah, the anything like the only young he did a good  change not about, It's not like completely related to the project. He said like for PSD will learning, you know, like all the a giant shortages but learning them like this semester this year and we have to apply them like so we have no time to actually study of those like a PC don't know what we're doing PSD."
P25,00:02:44,T6,Second,Offline,Just say this is so hard that they should just assume you're doing right.
P26,00:02:51,T6,Second,Offline,"Yeah, exactly."
P26,00:02:54,T6,Second,Offline,Apart from that I think that everything else is.
P25,00:02:56,T6,Second,Offline,It will take us very long to get started. Well those issues Mathew said a very big database and yet we're going to be to do.
P27,00:03:06,T6,Second,Offline,What do you mean?
P25,00:03:08,T6,Second,Offline,"You know, the issues like create a function does this?"
P26,00:03:12,T6,Second,Offline,"Yeah,."
P25,00:03:12,T6,Second,Offline,What are they do?
P26,00:03:14,T6,Second,Offline,I think so like yesterday. We met all together in collaborate and like my understanding what the poll said last time was that we had to develop like a prototype something that click.
P25,00:03:29,T6,Second,Offline,Yes.
P26,00:03:30,T6,Second,Offline,Delete are coded by like up till the Prototype.
P25,00:03:32,T6,Second,Offline,You say it's just some of the producers not good.
P26,00:03:34,T6,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P25,00:03:34,T6,Second,Offline,Per generation comes.
P26,00:03:36,T6,Second,Offline,I don't know if he means like something that we have to code or something. That could be like it just have to say something so it can be to say a file is gone.
P27,00:03:47,T6,Second,Offline,"You know yesterday make you sad that we don't really have to follow what the customer is saying is so yeah, but if we don't follow what he saying like tomorrow, but I don't know what to tell him like we can just meet up and say. I don't know."
P25,00:04:06,T6,Second,Offline,I'm sure is tomorrow.
P27,00:04:12,T6,Second,Offline,"Yeah, actually I should be tomorrow, but I don't know if the issues have to be done for tomorrow."
P25,00:04:31,T6,Second,Offline,No didn't just work at it tomorrow. But yet there are several bills.
P26,00:04:41,T6,Second,Offline,"Yeah, I think we should not be like earlier. I was thinking Pier Delle take very long."
P27,00:04:48,T6,Second,Offline,"No, I mean I think like for me because like now Morgan and I have to work on you know, I DPI and stuff. I think like we don't even have to write the code to get stuff from the API can just like let us say for example, assuming that we have this input. We just copied the Json response from the API. It just gives you that that's what we get and it's it because like if we actually perform like the well, even if it's not hard, but if you actually perform like the API call and it's basically that I mean that's what motivated really get over project like."
P25,00:05:24,T6,Second,Offline,It just seems to encroachment.
P26,00:05:26,T6,Second,Offline,Yeah exactly
P27,00:05:34,T6,Second,Offline,I get that done tomorrow  not tell me that the whole project was doing them.
P28,00:05:41,T6,Second,Offline,"Yeah, I don't know. Yeah I agree. It's easier small."
P25,00:05:50,T6,Second,Offline,Maybe some other ones are like I should think about ways C++.
P26,00:05:54,T6,Second,Offline,The lady who was that the kind of like the claw game right integrated plug-in.
P25,00:06:00,T6,Second,Offline,Yes.
P27,00:06:00,T6,Second,Offline,I was like that is really hard. Or even you can just to see the app development once.
P25,00:06:05,T6,Second,Offline,Because that's a whole new stuff to learn.
P28,00:06:19,T6,Second,Offline,What else can we say about the group?
P26,00:06:22,T6,Second,Offline,"I Mean, I think we're like a good group or like."
P27,00:06:26,T6,Second,Offline,It will go well.
P28,00:06:35,T6,Second,Offline,"Yeah, the only thing the only thing it is as I said before it's just that we really feel that we're not like very big prepared for this project. It just more like in terms of like."
P25,00:06:48,T6,Second,Offline,Yeah
P28,00:06:49,T6,Second,Offline,"You know, all  Agile things."
P25,00:06:51,T6,Second,Offline,Yeah
P28,00:06:53,T6,Second,Offline,It's more about like that. I mean.
P25,00:06:55,T6,Second,Offline,"There is no proper pile in Agile, I guess."
P28,00:06:58,T6,Second,Offline,"No, that's true. But yeah, I mean like."
P25,00:07:03,T6,Second,Offline,It seems a bit like we just ask the customer for some stuff into it.
P28,00:07:07,T6,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P25,00:07:07,T6,Second,Offline,It was that maybe our jokes as well.
P28,00:07:10,T6,Second,Offline,No exactly every time that we we meet with our coach is always like saying have you done this never like what's this? It's because we don't know.
P25,00:07:23,T6,Second,Offline,You probably didn't know what taken.
P28,00:07:24,T6,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P25,00:07:24,T6,Second,Offline,It's for some attention. There's some move where it was.
P28,00:07:29,T6,Second,Offline,It's true.
P27,00:07:37,T6,Second,Offline,How do I stop?
P26,00:07:46,T6,Second,Offline,I think you stopped seven minutes and 48.
P25,00:07:49,T6,Second,Offline,That's a whole a hour.
P26,00:07:50,T6,Second,Offline,"I think that's all right, I mean."
P25,00:07:52,T6,Second,Offline,Yeah
P19,00:00:43,T5,Second,Offline,Just have to go through those questions.
P20,00:00:48,T5,Second,Offline,We can just start like this. Because off with curry curry to signed up for the center a choice of contention whole city. I like first accurate.
P19,00:01:15,T5,Second,Offline,"Okay, I guess probably concerned about the scope of the project."
P20,00:01:45,T5,Second,Offline,I think I did find that the scope of the we will do for you. Hope you can just cover the project that can be fluctuating.
P21,00:01:54,T5,Second,Offline,"Yeah, I mean I think for now not really what if I guess if we want to get to I don't want to do the received power is 1 then I'll be kind of excited by the scope."
P20,00:02:15,T5,Second,Offline,What part?
P19,00:02:16,T5,Second,Offline,I don't know.
P21,00:02:16,T5,Second,Offline,It's still not impossible they only one that thinks that but.
P20,00:02:25,T5,Second,Offline,"It's doable but the time that we might have to take maybe a bit concerning before thing, but overall,."
P20,00:02:35,T5,Second,Offline,I think we have a good idea.
P19,00:02:39,T5,Second,Offline,"Yeah, since we've done pretty well. So it's always going to surprise us that body. Yeah, especially as I feel like we are good at coming up with the simplest solution for each of the sub tasks. How about you?"
P22,00:02:50,T5,Second,Offline,"Yeah, I feel the same. I think I mean the fact that the requirements change might mean that the scope might increase as well, but for the for like the way it stands now, I'm not comfortable."
P23,00:03:08,T5,Second,Offline,Yep. I still think is very doable but we have right now.
P21,00:03:14,T5,Second,Offline,"Well, then do we have to work across teams?"
P21,00:03:16,T5,Second,Offline,As in the other Cooper group?
P19,00:03:19,T5,Second,Offline,I guess.
P22,00:03:20,T5,Second,Offline,None of ya know the fold. I mean I don't know is it too because you're not the guy from the other team is really doing like literally the same or?
P21,00:03:37,T5,Second,Offline,"I would say it's roughly the same like he didn't distract too much in detail to me like exactly what they were going to do. Ha ha but I would say it's roughly the same because you know, it's still terrible and he has wonderful."
P21,00:03:50,T5,Second,Offline,Do they know how are they doing because they are better than us or.
P20,00:03:54,T5,Second,Offline,They're doing more or less in the same level.
P21,00:04:00,T5,Second,Offline,"Yeah, I mean I guess it wasn't enough for this trick is not like even though it's we have like enough people to like work together on things or somebody. That's awesome. It's unbelievable. How about you?. We should work across teams."
P22,00:04:17,T5,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P21,00:04:17,T5,Second,Offline,I mean we can make it we can talk to them just to see how they're getting on.
P23,00:04:22,T5,Second,Offline,We can collaborate collaborate here and there and.
P21,00:04:25,T5,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P19,00:04:25,T5,Second,Offline,"Yeah. I guess like I think we valuable to like have like share ideas. Maybe I'm like or like share like advice, but I know I'm like it would be it would actually like share code I think."
P21,00:04:45,T5,Second,Offline,Yeah be interesting to see following implemented their solution of like without any comparison to us.
P19,00:04:53,T5,Second,Offline,Yeah Like maybe that's something we could do.
P21,00:04:57,T5,Second,Offline,Although I don't know maybe maybe Darn would should be communicating both of us or something. He's like announcements. That will make like his life easier. So you create like a common Slack chat or something like this or you don't feel it's necessary.
P19,00:05:19,T5,Second,Offline,I think it' up to him basically.
P21,00:05:21,T5,Second,Offline,"I think it has been suggested, so I think it's good."
P20,00:05:23,T5,Second,Offline,I think actually it wouldn't be that easy and maybe at first but later we're going to diverge are applied. So probably have to manage Two things that want anyone's like there might be a bit annoying for it.
P22,00:05:34,T5,Second,Offline,We need to go over the questions if you can sit here maybe close to us
P21,00:05:43,T5,Second,Offline,We are the second to this moment. Do you think we have to work across teams?
P19,00:05:56,T5,Second,Offline,As in the other Cooper group.
P23,00:05:59,T5,Second,Offline,"No,  I don't think so. Too much painful"
P19,00:05:59,T5,Second,Offline,I was saying you couldn't like maybe like me once or twice just to like talk to them. They like what they think.
P23,00:06:13,T5,Second,Offline,They Might have to completely different understandings and they might be doing it a completely different way.
P21,00:06:19,T5,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P19,00:06:19,T5,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P20,00:06:19,T5,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P21,00:06:21,T5,Second,Offline,Have we decided to use a new technology to us? If so is concerning?
P19,00:06:28,T5,Second,Offline,Just few libraries and mostly django which you already kind of familiar with so.
P21,00:06:36,T5,Second,Offline,It must be building on things that we we've done before here.
P19,00:06:42,T5,Second,Offline,And I look at the library and they sing not too hard to use as well. So as you all right the OCR I look at the documentation during the lecture today and it was kind of all right good.
P21,00:06:52,T5,Second,Offline,I think The point of this project to kind of cross with like new technologies and stuff like that.
P19,00:07:01,T5,Second,Offline,It's more like discipline.
P21,00:07:03,T5,Second,Offline,"Yes, most important the software process itself. So you'll be a bit of an Overkill. Anybody else other point of view or somthing like that."
P22,00:07:17,T5,Second,Offline,"Angular is going to be new as well. But yeah, nothing to do."
P21,00:07:23,T5,Second,Offline,Angular should have or will be nice. It's not like we are forcing myself to like bootstrap or something.
P20,00:07:33,T5,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P19,00:07:34,T5,Second,Offline,"But yeah, in case we ended up using angular I would say that with that would be the biggest challenge in terms of Technology wise, but pretty much mostly I do this. I would say we're not too concerned."
P19,00:07:50,T5,Second,Offline,Next question.
P21,00:07:53,T5,Second,Offline,What do you think about Darling? So how do we find barriers for costumers?
P21,00:07:59,T5,Second,Offline,I understand that this like he's lowest priority this project like the people like he's recruiting us. It's not like Cooper software like significantly benefit of this time.
P19,00:08:24,T5,Second,Offline,I think I may be like Darrell more than what was the thing?
P22,00:08:31,T5,Second,Offline,"I agree. Actually, I agree from what I hear from the other groups. I think I think the arrow is actually doing much better than."
P19,00:08:37,T5,Second,Offline,Yeah. I was I was going to say also a really good friend. It's not like.
P21,00:08:40,T5,Second,Offline,"What I liked the most is actually a software company. So he underlines the importance of the cultures because other other other men, like other customers who live in karbas or gitlab here, he push us."
P19,00:08:54,T5,Second,Offline,Like dose't even understand much about the gitlab. Since he is a technology guy. He must understand technology. And I think that's one of the biggest benefits from Terry.
P20,00:09:05,T5,Second,Offline,"Yeah. Yeah, especially because so far do we kind of just being all kind of gathering funny stuff. I think we might be able to see more benefit the more like code and the writing and  you can actually talk to them in life that you don't understand."
P19,00:09:20,T5,Second,Offline,And since we started developing DeRosa promise to you because so communicating with us more often.
P21,00:09:30,T5,Second,Offline,But maybe if he was a tec guy then we would have more freedom of choice when comes to how to implement stuff because now we have like so in his requirements like he he has like all these architectures and stuff like that already plans like feels an integrative idea whether it can be a server or it can become scientists.
P23,00:09:57,T5,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P19,00:10:00,T5,Second,Offline,I mean a lot of that stuff. So it's not like a requirement. It's just kind of like to do this and it's I know it can be easier if you just like to know exactly what you need to do as opposed to having to figure out scratch.
P21,00:10:23,T5,Second,Offline,So what are we finding cover coaches Useful?
P19,00:10:29,T5,Second,Offline,Somebody answers that please.
P20,00:10:31,T5,Second,Offline,"I think last time. He wasn't very useful to be honest and just gonna like leave it. That's the other day. He didn't receive any particular answer. Maybe I just like ten questions. I very much agree with it. But before that he was helpful, but with the customer games and jobs thing."
P19,00:10:50,T5,Second,Offline,It's still quite a beginning for now. So we have to monitor like our later progress and see how much input we can get from him. But for last week as you said he wasn't really that useful.
P20,00:11:10,T5,Second,Offline,Maybe a way to go about it is to kind of gather questions before meetings so you can prepar.
P21,00:11:19,T5,Second,Offline,Also he is a forth-year student.
P19,00:11:30,T5,Second,Offline,Fifth
P21,00:11:31,T5,Second,Offline,Is he Fifth?
P19,00:11:31,T5,Second,Offline,"No he is doing Masters, he is the fifth year."
P21,00:11:35,T5,Second,Offline,So it's a two years ago for him thrid-year project.
P19,00:11:39,T5,Second,Offline,Yes
P21,00:11:40,T5,Second,Offline,So I understand saying busiest as a fact . The other has also accused of course and should't be in our attention. How's the cooperation between other teams and their coaches ago.
P19,00:11:58,T5,Second,Offline,A few of my friends that their coaches were quite active
P20,00:12:05,T5,Second,Offline,That's what I heard.
P20,00:12:06,T5,Second,Offline,That's why I was a bit concerned.
P23,00:12:11,T5,Second,Offline,"He is fine I guess, mostly has to start with the planning until they can make sure that you really understand that. We really understood the requirements to start."
P20,00:12:29,T5,Second,Offline,That has traffic like maybe it's like the last week or so and because we have to do something before.
P19,00:12:43,T5,Second,Offline,"Have we changed the structure of the team get if so, how?"
P22,00:12:49,T5,Second,Offline,"Did we really? Well because right at the beginning we technically came up with like roles, but don't things done to them anywhere it before."
P23,00:12:59,T5,Second,Offline,"Yeah, I know."
P19,00:13:02,T5,Second,Offline,I think so far
P20,00:13:05,T5,Second,Offline,We don't really have a formal structure and maybe that's something we shouldn't do.
P21,00:13:16,T5,Second,Offline,Steer the program other I think.
P20,00:13:21,T5,Second,Offline,Captain captain Grover.
P19,00:13:27,T5,Second,Offline,Covers definitely achieved out that strong arose Gotta Do
P20,00:13:38,T5,Second,Offline,I just beautiful. I mean I'll just keep us thinking of all the projects. So we have some structure however other teams approaching at the because I think we would meet like like more than others. Is it true or not?
P22,00:14:00,T5,Second,Offline,"I think I think so. Well, yeah, I think compared to average we were like up there. Yeah, but not at the top. I know that especially this crime were a group. They're super busy."
P19,00:14:12,T5,Second,Offline,They start like developing stuff.
P22,00:14:14,T5,Second,Offline,It's more like they're meeting your customer like every two or three days or something.
P19,00:14:20,T5,Second,Offline,Is he driving to Edinburgh or just like?
P19,00:14:24,T5,Second,Offline,"Mostly video video meeting. I know that they had him on Wednesday and they're meeting him today in us on Sunday. But I was to say that the frequency of the amount that we're meeting we still up there, which is good. First dedicated 30 out of 120 in year two."
P20,00:14:50,T5,Second,Offline,"Truth and beauty is another family has 30s for two semesters. So in essence, it's just 15 truth."
P19,00:15:05,T5,Second,Offline,Omg that doesn't make you a business project.
P21,00:15:12,T5,Second,Offline,I know other teams have like a team leader and we don't we all really later and that's what that's a good thing or not.
P20,00:15:23,T5,Second,Offline,Like all remain between Gates of the project so that we don't need to leave each other to work.
P21,00:15:31,T5,Second,Offline,We're also at least like two very distinct parts and also many sub parts. So it would be difficult for one person to oversee the whole thing.
P22,00:15:46,T5,Second,Offline,That it's true.
P19,00:15:48,T5,Second,Offline,"And also the same time all of us. I'm pretty sure what to do the technical Parts as well in order to get experience. You know, I proposed cut one thing remember someone just kept watching how the team is doing literally doing nothing."
P20,00:16:08,T5,Second,Offline,Can you push the person with the worst GPA after in May?
P21,00:16:17,T5,Second,Offline,Okay.
P22,00:16:26,T5,Second,Offline,Maybe someone who did pass in whims algorithm could be the leader.
P20,00:16:29,T5,Second,Offline,The best notice the words because someone who'd like to either.
P21,00:16:36,T5,Second,Offline,I would say someone who got D would be the best already. Any ideas too?
P20,00:16:44,T5,Second,Offline,I think.
P21,00:16:47,T5,Second,Offline,I hope what I got when I stood that got censored later.
P19,00:16:54,T5,Second,Offline,I guess it was actualy that pertty stright forwrad.
P10,00:00:16,T3,Second,Offline,Are we concerned about the scope of the project?
P12,00:00:24,T3,Second,Offline,I don't I don't feel particularly concerned after the first call.
P13,00:00:33,T3,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P12,00:00:33,T3,Second,Offline,After like after braking it down into sections. That's kind of helps us a bit. We can plan better feel like that's a bit harsh.
P13,00:00:44,T3,Second,Offline,Do we have to work across teams? What do they mean? like and others?
P10,00:00:50,T3,Second,Offline,"Yeah with the other team because like some group is kind of collaborate. Yeah, so well-known, we don't have to work across teams."
P12,00:01:02,T3,Second,Offline,I mean I  already suggested that's not really.
P13,00:01:05,T3,Second,Offline,Yeah. I think If they joining us it is not
P12,00:01:08,T3,Second,Offline,Not practical.
P10,00:01:11,T3,Second,Offline,Do you know how they are doing?
P13,00:01:13,T3,Second,Offline,"I messaged Guillaume like I saw you try that you posted in the group one side, maybe just message me directly because I don't think you just like didn't respond. So I look like I know but like I've had a conversation with him since like in person that's fine. So I'm, I don't know."
P12,00:01:31,T3,Second,Offline,Really?
P13,00:01:32,T3,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P13,00:01:33,T3,Second,Offline,"Have we decided to use new technology to us? Yes, we did, it's concerning."
P10,00:01:54,T3,Second,Offline,I see like the kind of connection with jungle.
P13,00:01:58,T3,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P10,00:01:58,T3,Second,Offline,It's like okay. I kind of know how it works.
P13,00:02:01,T3,Second,Offline,And like if you Google it there's some stuff.
P10,00:02:03,T3,Second,Offline,I just need some time to kind of get used to it. Also. I found out tutorial about angular bootstrap.
P13,00:02:12,T3,Second,Offline,Oh.
P10,00:02:12,T3,Second,Offline,So happy since since as well we can just.
P13,00:02:17,T3,Second,Offline,We've done it for I am a bit concerned just because I to me is like a big question mark and I don't.
P10,00:02:24,T3,Second,Offline,"Yeah and also like the, you know, the like elastic search for you and the data thing."
P13,00:02:32,T3,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P10,00:02:32,T3,Second,Offline,I never used it.
P12,00:02:34,T3,Second,Offline,"I feel like maybe once we reach nice it down and once we start actually the first thing we'll through other people like Amiga, but they are not realized. I have no idea what stalkers enough to said. I explained it to me what it was and it was detail."
P10,00:02:57,T3,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P12,00:02:57,T3,Second,Offline,How are we finding the behavior or customers?
P10,00:03:04,T3,Second,Offline,He is very Helpful
P12,00:03:05,T3,Second,Offline,Yes very helpful
P13,00:03:08,T3,Second,Offline,I think he's like pushing us to see how we respond kind of like.
P10,00:03:16,T3,Second,Offline,He wants to see what we did.
P13,00:03:18,T3,Second,Offline,Yeah
P10,00:03:18,T3,Second,Offline,"Even though when we told him like about the Meeting today. He was like, you're cool."
P13,00:03:24,T3,Second,Offline,Yeah
P12,00:03:24,T3,Second,Offline,I feel like when you have something good-ish.
P13,00:03:29,T3,Second,Offline,"Shit, have you reply to him about that?"
P12,00:03:29,T3,Second,Offline,"No, I did not."
P13,00:03:29,T3,Second,Offline,I will do that now
P12,00:03:34,T3,Second,Offline,He said something else. He's got something all day.
P10,00:03:40,T3,Second,Offline,He just asked us if it's ok. Otherwise like Saturday morning.
P12,00:03:48,T3,Second,Offline,Sarah's opened another issue.
P13,00:03:53,T3,Second,Offline,"Like in some ways, like glad that at least if she's not here, she's still working on team project."
P12,00:04:00,T3,Second,Offline,We spend ages yesterday.
P10,00:04:04,T3,Second,Offline,She works so much I was trying to keep up.
P12,00:04:09,T3,Second,Offline,I was still getting up this my falling like will work log half obviously carry stuff.
P10,00:04:18,T3,Second,Offline,"After 9 I'm done, completely dead."
P13,00:04:22,T3,Second,Offline,"I have to take a break between 6 p.m. Till about 8:00 9:00 p.m. I can't do shit for like uni, and then after that show, but."
P12,00:04:32,T3,Second,Offline,Fair enough. Are we finding our coaches useful? Danny is very helpful.
P10,00:04:39,T3,Second,Offline,Yes.
P12,00:04:41,T3,Second,Offline,I thought I think actually had a jackpot with Danny.
P10,00:04:44,T3,Second,Offline,"Yes,."
P12,00:04:44,T3,Second,Offline,He's really good.
P13,00:04:46,T3,Second,Offline,Massively
P12,00:04:46,T3,Second,Offline,"Yeah, definitely. I can always just asking for help and stuff like that."
P10,00:05:01,T3,Second,Offline,Are we meeting him tomorrow?
P13,00:05:04,T3,Second,Offline,Donnie? Probably
P12,00:05:04,T3,Second,Offline,I don't even we need use the scanner cards.
P10,00:05:08,T3,Second,Offline,I hope you'll be happy with all the issues we have now.
P12,00:05:14,T3,Second,Offline,I actually think you see we have to manually.
P10,00:05:21,T3,Second,Offline,Because like on the screenshot he posted like off his board last year. They have like the same.
P13,00:05:29,T3,Second,Offline,I think so.
P13,00:05:30,T3,Second,Offline,That's true. Have we changed the structure the team? we have formalized it.
P10,00:05:37,T3,Second,Offline,We formalized the teams roles and everyone decided.
P12,00:05:46,T3,Second,Offline,They're kind of pretty flexible So.
P10,00:05:48,T3,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P12,00:05:50,T3,Second,Offline,"That was what five minutes. Well, still more questions,."
P10,00:05:57,T3,Second,Offline,No that's it.
P13,00:05:58,T3,Second,Offline,I think. We just we've already discussed all this stuff like likes in our own time.
P10,00:06:06,T3,Second,Offline,"Yeah, because we very often."
P13,00:06:08,T3,Second,Offline,"Yeah,."
P12,00:06:08,T3,Second,Offline,We do me very often. There's some clips the only meat like once everything's very often.
P10,00:06:17,T3,Second,Offline,We like keep communicating in this course. So like.
P12,00:06:20,T3,Second,Offline,That's good.
P10,00:06:20,T3,Second,Offline,It's really good.
P12,00:06:22,T3,Second,Offline,Help us for the Final thing. I'm guessing we're doing more we could be doing stuff in December.
P13,00:06:30,T3,Second,Offline,"Yeah. Yeah, like I heard some fourth you like Martina and I was sitting in the level one lab and bunch of fourth years, which will be about how like, they just weren't on the team project stuff like well, hopefully if we're talking like a lot now we won't have to do because I feel like a lot of people just push it back and push it back and push it back."
P10,00:06:51,T3,Second,Offline,I mean I know of some groups that have been started anything yet. They are still like kind of working on documentation So..
P12,00:07:01,T3,Second,Offline,I feel like tomorrow will probably be a big

P12,00:07:18,T3,Second,Offline,I still need only thermal dilatation.
P10,00:07:21,T3,Second,Offline,"Probably we need to customize it. It's like what because you weren't there when when Adam showed us like the tamplete , but it's just like white web page where the sidebar and then you can like change pages on the sidebar."
P12,00:07:39,T3,Second,Offline,See the screenshot ship yesterday. Is that with the web pages spoused to be?
P10,00:07:45,T3,Second,Offline,Yeah I think so.
P12,00:07:49,T3,Second,Offline,She put this.
P13,00:07:52,T3,Second,Offline,In general
P12,00:07:52,T3,Second,Offline,"I think it is. Yeah, that one is that?"
P10,00:08:05,T3,Second,Offline,"Yeah. Well, it is missing a part. There is also."
P12,00:08:11,T3,Second,Offline,Is that like the basic web page really?

P13,00:08:23,T3,Second,Offline,"I see, it's responsive."
P10,00:08:25,T3,Second,Offline,"Yeah, it's I think I think he's like already made with some bootstrap emotional in there like a desktop version 3 is a sidebar on like so and you can change Pages which which in this well, can we use lightscope? That was quie good name as well."
P13,00:08:44,T3,Second,Offline,Thank you. I was thinking like you put different bits together and you get it. So sorry and it changes over time.
P12,00:08:55,T3,Second,Offline,"What have to alternate, don't we? Are you have to lose with names?"
P13,00:09:02,T3,Second,Offline,I just kind of like shocked a bunch.

P10,00:10:26,T3,Second,Offline,I mean if there were like issues it would be yeah sure. I mean we are being very honest with each other.
P10,00:10:37,T3,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P13,00:10:43,T3,Second,Offline,To get more used to Sarah's technical waves because she's gonna eventually just going to get annoyed with me just being like explain this to me simpler cuz I'm going be saying.
P10,00:10:56,T3,Second,Offline,"We she explains things. I'm like, okay, I'm going to understand this. So I started listen and then like after a couple of minutes. She just I don't know it's just like. but she knows alot of stuff"
P13,00:11:14,T3,Second,Offline,"Yes. Yes, so glad."

P12,00:11:39,T3,Second,Offline,"Yeah, I just I just said I'm gonna be off the you say techniques. I hadn't said I just said I was interested in you're interested in your CV. They just called me feel like they got two minute chat like your interviews to be another good."
P13,00:12:00,T3,Second,Offline,He tried to get him to do the week before that.
P12,00:12:04,T3,Second,Offline,Did he?
P13,00:12:04,T3,Second,Offline,"Yeah And I was like, no I still need to learn all of this. Like I think the coding interview shit and I don't know idea of."
P12,00:12:14,T3,Second,Offline,I started with my yesterday.
P13,00:12:16,T3,Second,Offline,Nice
P13,00:12:27,T3,Second,Offline,Second round of something?
P10,00:12:27,T3,Second,Offline,PWC
P10,00:12:35,T3,Second,Offline,I couldn't seelp I was like shit.
P13,00:12:46,T3,Second,Offline,"Yeah, the way they could distort your three year, I think. I don't know. Like I feel like interviews are so important. There's just not a lot of support for there's a whole different conversation."
P12,00:12:59,T3,Second,Offline,"I know but we're getting awfully good discussion. We have anything you know, what points?"
P10,00:13:14,T3,Second,Offline,How long are we going to work in December if?
P12,00:13:20,T3,Second,Offline,I'm going to go away from the 18th But from the 15th my dad will be.
P13,00:13:30,T3,Second,Offline,"I'm like 20 20 second dish until whenever semester starts by now, but I was thinking we should just set a time that works at like three specific days or four days over the break kind of time period and because obviously like we'll have to be flexible with how people plans."
P12,00:13:53,T3,Second,Offline,I go up in the seventh or different five days. It's been bigger has a flat bill. So it's just going over there for like five days.
P13,00:14:05,T3,Second,Offline,Let me guess siner dorm
P13,00:14:06,T3,Second,Offline,No it's Alicante.
P13,00:14:09,T3,Second,Offline,Oh nice
P12,00:14:11,T3,Second,Offline,So I'm back from the 12th.
P13,00:14:12,T3,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P12,00:14:13,T3,Second,Offline,I'm paying after that. So I feel like there's ample may be quite busy one for the team project.
P13,00:14:20,T3,Second,Offline,"Yeah, for sure."
P12,00:14:20,T3,Second,Offline,Considering when we go back will be immortal.
P10,00:14:23,T3,Second,Offline,When is the final deadline for the project?
P13,00:14:26,T3,Second,Offline,Fifth.
P10,00:14:26,T3,Second,Offline,Before exams.
P13,00:14:32,T3,Second,Offline,Yeah deifntaly. I think it;s Like march or the end of March. We when we when we went well it's way less than that.
P12,00:15:01,T3,Second,Offline,It seems they all you've only got like if 80% wait. Yeah to see what six months ended up putting everything but then it's goes so fast.
P10,00:15:15,T3,Second,Offline,"Yeah. The thing is thinking that it is at the end of this year. I'm like, oh this so It's not."
P12,00:15:26,T3,Second,Offline,What always ready four weeks left of first semester made to last because.
P10,00:15:41,T3,Second,Offline,We don't have exams like yesterday when we received the email for like example second thing. I thought it was like thank in December like the first two weeks think about the gym.
P12,00:15:57,T3,Second,Offline,"If we had exams, I don't think I've got a don't like there's no chance to do think project all the assignments apply for internships and do exams for five four subjects will chance."
P10,00:16:16,T3,Second,Offline,Think about the ethics exam.
P13,00:16:19,T3,Second,Offline,For real like May is gonna be hell.
P12,00:16:23,T3,Second,Offline,I Know probably I would say from March is going to be clear when you start studying.
P13,00:16:28,T3,Second,Offline,Yeah hundred percent.
P10,00:16:29,T3,Second,Offline,The only exam I will Is IS. Like in December because like we have already done everything you need to see I and so I'm kind of like yeah.
P13,00:16:45,T3,Second,Offline,Just one exam that would be so much better.
P12,00:16:48,T3,Second,Offline,"Anything either of those subjects I couldn't do. So if you like from March, I'm just going to have to stand for like."
P13,00:16:54,T3,Second,Offline,This is why I'm staying guards go until like the 20 20 second just because I can work in the library and hopefully plan is to like bash out all the revision for that stuff before it's going to involve some serious time management skills. I don't know if I have it.
P12,00:17:12,T3,Second,Offline,"I can do my part to get woman with sale before Christmas. So then when I come back I can then get a new batch of notes. Yeah, but then it's in have an e- those notes as well as do."
P13,00:17:23,T3,Second,Offline,Because otherwise I just constantly going to be behind all of the next semester like if you don't start that shit out and over break like.
P12,00:17:32,T3,Second,Offline,Then it's weird because before I used to think or how work hard the next couple months and I can't relax for someone but now you've had like two weeks off and if we get the internship in.
P13,00:17:45,T3,Second,Offline,Internships are quie fun I enjoyed them.
P12,00:17:46,T3,Second,Offline,Are they?
P13,00:17:46,T3,Second,Offline,Yeah
P10,00:17:48,T3,Second,Offline,"I mean at least when you when you start working at night, you don't have anything else to do you don't have to get changes."
P13,00:17:56,T3,Second,Offline,"The mindset is completely different you go home and you're like, oh shit. I can actually enjoy myself. I don't need to constantly feel guilty."
P12,00:18:03,T3,Second,Offline,I feel also have a weekend as well. See your sadness on this we can just relex.
P13,00:18:11,T3,Second,Offline,"Yes, like to all of this weekend someone mentioned as out of librarians. I was like, oh my God made us computer science. He's overdoing DF right now. I got so freaked out. I like pulled out my laptop. Don't ask me why I pulled out my laptop. I started working on and they were like, what are you doing? I was like I can't guess. Fucking university."
P6,00:00:08,T2,Second,Offline,"The first item on the list, are we concerned about the scope of the project? Is it easy to write, or very"
P7,00:00:21,T2,Second,Offline,Defiantly not wide
P8,00:00:21,T2,Second,Offline,It's an an andriod app.
P6,00:00:22,T2,Second,Offline,"What can add note on that, P6: it's not wide."
P7,00:00:24,T2,Second,Offline,It's not wide.
P6,00:00:24,T2,Second,Offline,It's limited in scope.
P8,00:00:27,T2,Second,Offline,Even the other things that you suggest we had in our stove within scope of like all just wondering one more extra function.
P7,00:00:35,T2,Second,Offline,"yeah extra functions are just fancy stuff. Like hey, I would like to see the location from Judy the GPS when the view provision doesn't pass. No big deal just function like GPS location and saving some ways."
P6,00:00:49,T2,Second,Offline,The apis is already there so.
P7,00:00:50,T2,Second,Offline,"Yes, not big deals quite straightforward."
P8,00:00:53,T2,Second,Offline,Okay I feel we have passed that question already.
P6,00:00:59,T2,Second,Offline,Yeah
P7,00:00:59,T2,Second,Offline,I mean the point here is becuase really like we have so far is not a much and scope is pretty quite straightforward.
P8,00:01:08,T2,Second,Offline,Yeah
P6,00:01:09,T2,Second,Offline,Do we have to work across teams?
P7,00:01:12,T2,Second,Offline,We don't have to work across teams. As far as I know. We are the only one working on this project so.
P6,00:01:16,T2,Second,Offline,No no collaboration needed anything like.
P9,00:01:19,T2,Second,Offline,There's no T spotter years not just kind.
P7,00:01:21,T2,Second,Offline,I guess like maybe you could interpret that as like since we're dividing and to look at myself for doing the pike on stuff you in here again apps off then maybe that's two teams. I don't really know.
P6,00:01:33,T2,Second,Offline,So we have like a like a team within team.
P7,00:01:35,T2,Second,Offline,"Kind of I guess we don't have to work across teams, but we're dividing the work up."
P9,00:01:42,T2,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P7,00:01:43,T2,Second,Offline,Quite noisy thing
P6,00:01:45,T2,Second,Offline,Have we decided to use a new technology because.
P7,00:01:49,T2,Second,Offline,"Yes, I guess we did with I guess we didn't really decide to."
P8,00:01:53,T2,Second,Offline,Well. we didn't decide we've been provided by new technologies so.
P7,00:01:57,T2,Second,Offline,"Yeah, like I haven't done anything with like a firefighter by a python module haven't coded micropython before."
P8,00:02:03,T2,Second,Offline,I guess from what I found on the documentation the Border lies not uncommon either. So I think.
P6,00:02:09,T2,Second,Offline,I won't count this as I mean we need to do the hard work.
P8,00:02:15,T2,Second,Offline,Yeah you're new to do stuff.
P7,00:02:17,T2,Second,Offline,For the idea behind it is something we familiar with.
P8,00:02:21,T2,Second,Offline,YouTube's new to start will be provided with what we didn't decide any new technology.
P7,00:02:26,T2,Second,Offline,"Yeah. Yeah, but it's like at least the Android development Studio. Did you see you've done some before?"
P6,00:02:32,T2,Second,Offline,I've done it before
P7,00:02:33,T2,Second,Offline,At least two of you know it or any way that is probably like new app.
P6,00:02:37,T2,Second,Offline,"Yeah, obviously few things have changed since the last time I actually develop an app, but"
P7,00:02:43,T2,Second,Offline,"Yeah, it's close enough."
P6,00:02:45,T2,Second,Offline,"The learning curve it would not be that, you know being being like that."
P7,00:02:49,T2,Second,Offline,"If so, it concerned? I don't really see it as do concerning like everyone in the group has experience with yeah coding."
P8,00:03:03,T2,Second,Offline,"I mean got away even if new technology like all the stuff is many stuff wee know already it's a play on different devices different categories of like different matters, but still the same stuff doesn't change even if you have something you or what I have to deal with Bluetooth. Okay, you still have the API have the module you hold same functions just programmers use as your mother learned it from a she sorry minded to do we can so like University taught you to problems."
P6,00:03:33,T2,Second,Offline,That's that's better.
P7,00:03:34,T2,Second,Offline,That's better one obviously.
P8,00:03:38,T2,Second,Offline,So Yeah.
P6,00:03:39,T2,Second,Offline,Are we finding the behavior of how we find behavior for our customers?
P7,00:03:45,T2,Second,Offline,"Norman's good for contact like this is good getting back to the some stuff is very vague in terms of this requirement, which I don't like."
P8,00:03:58,T2,Second,Offline,"It's the I think we need talks he likes to talk in the whole idea that he has in mind if I hit it talks more in he talks about all the things you how I was just wants to have any future all the things you will have to work within some time and how to live it is customer sometime. It's all the things that you would like to have in his own project. But what the stuff they us is that is asking us to do it was pretty vague. Even though the last time I must admit it was very specific and he said I just want this for now and what he meant by that I was just like I want just enough that will provision 5 mm,."
P7,00:04:36,T2,Second,Offline,Right
P8,00:04:38,T2,Second,Offline,We haven't provided a little survey yet because I believe he is not interested in us right now to work on Laura. He's only interested to get us working on the Bluetooth between the Android app.
P6,00:04:53,T2,Second,Offline,I mean I can email him again to it's been how many days now since I think it was a Friday last Friday We saw him?
P7,00:05:00,T2,Second,Offline,"No, it was two Fridays before."
P6,00:05:03,T2,Second,Offline,I can email him today or tomorrow just to see.
P7,00:05:07,T2,Second,Offline,Oh we're gonna meet him next week anyways.
P6,00:05:09,T2,Second,Offline,Is it was living in modernity in might bring it in? You know should I if we tell you if we minded now in my upon them along.
P8,00:05:16,T2,Second,Offline,The margin of the doubt we have to end this project probably March so we still have cover lots of time.
P6,00:05:24,T2,Second,Offline,We do.
P8,00:05:25,T2,Second,Offline,So we do have a the things they gave us there are no many and we have lots of time ahead. So most probably you're going to spend last time adding new features them as they have liked to have the key we can pull it like.
P6,00:05:37,T2,Second,Offline,Anything You want Mr. Norman? We had it. Anything you want? We had it.
P6,00:05:46,T2,Second,Offline,Are we finding our coaches useful?
P8,00:05:50,T2,Second,Offline,Yeah
P7,00:05:51,T2,Second,Offline,We only have got one coach right?
P8,00:05:54,T2,Second,Offline,"Yeah, I mean we holding one coach. I think so. Yeah, therefore useful in Agile mostly because I mean programming they can only do what they can to up to the knowledge only comes to our agile methodologies and grunting calm best practices. They are very useful thing to suggest how to work and"
P6,00:06:14,T2,Second,Offline,To point us in the tell us what we are not doing which is which is very helpful because then if you know what you're not doing you can start to say yeah.
P8,00:06:24,T2,Second,Offline,"Basically if we going the wrong way, she just said sighs back in the right path."
P6,00:06:29,T2,Second,Offline,"Hey guys, stop your wandering into the bush"
P7,00:06:35,T2,Second,Offline,I was quite happy to just let it go and do our work which quite like is well not too obtrusive interest events that either.
P6,00:06:40,T2,Second,Offline,"Have we changed the structure of the team yet. If so, how and why?"
P7,00:06:46,T2,Second,Offline,"Well, we did change the starture to."
P8,00:06:48,T2,Second,Offline,"No we didn't change, did we?"
P7,00:06:50,T2,Second,Offline,"Yeah, we changed it from all four of his doing whatever which was."
P8,00:06:53,T2,Second,Offline,"I mean, this is the beginning."
P6,00:06:55,T2,Second,Offline,That was that was not added to the structure.
P7,00:06:57,T2,Second,Offline,"Yeah, we're going from not having to structure their life is changing the structure. I mean technically."
P8,00:07:04,T2,Second,Offline,We didn't really not appointed to question. So we didn't change. We're still sticking on the structure we decided from the beginning.
P6,00:07:17,T2,Second,Offline,"Yes, but what we did say that, you know, it's they're not all the world that we have at the moment are not set in stone we can declare."
P8,00:07:26,T2,Second,Offline,"Yeah, I was thinking actually them this structural might change in the future because for what I understood from Norman that it would like to have more featuring and featuring more features in the future. The features are going to be like more up wise pies on so what are you doing what they think is there any future My tall ship to the op in the end."
P9,00:07:48,T2,Second,Offline,"Yeah, and then just work on the pi comma is needed because."
P8,00:07:51,T2,Second,Offline,"Yeah, because in Python you from wouldn't it for what I saw basically has everything already prepped for python."
P7,00:07:56,T2,Second,Offline,All the apis are just there we need change some.
P8,00:07:59,T2,Second,Offline,Yeah know that's interesting. We hustled like he showed us you were in there when you showed us showed us all the classes already prepared prepared for the sensors. So it was like a queen just like this class saying it worse where would it whichever sensory input so it really helped the called prepared. So it's the only the provisioning part. He's very interested in.
P6,00:08:19,T2,Second,Offline,"I was in the team is open to he is fluid-- you know, as I was new features is requested anyone can volunteer to do this stuff."
P7,00:08:32,T2,Second,Offline,A very agile.
P6,00:08:33,T2,Second,Offline,Yeah very agile.
P8,00:08:36,T2,Second,Offline,"So, are we done already."
P6,00:08:41,T2,Second,Offline,It seems so.
P8,00:08:44,T2,Second,Offline,Because this was a quite quick.
P6,00:08:46,T2,Second,Offline,I know.
P15,00:00:00,T4,Second,Offline,Are we converd about the scope of the project?
P14,00:00:00,T4,Second,Offline,I'm really concerned.
P15,00:00:02,T4,Second,Offline,"It was just, I think what we thought it was easier because Mat and Jan told us that they would be able to do it very quickly, but I think they're busy or lazy like everyone else like us as well because the cold weather making me so lazy now anyway, so I'm kind of worried as well not I don't think we'll be able to I think we'll be able to do it but not as quickly as I would have wanted. I wanted to be done with it as soon as possible."
P14,00:00:34,T4,Second,Offline,Yes.
P15,00:00:35,T4,Second,Offline,Now that it's like it just keeps going and going and going I still want that but I'm not worried. I think we'll be able to do it.
P14,00:00:44,T4,Second,Offline,Okay
P15,00:00:44,T4,Second,Offline,"We have a good team. So it's a very good team. Number to do you if have to work across teams. We cant dot it right I would really like to like coordinate with the other team. First of all, I want to be quicker than the other team."
P14,00:01:03,T4,Second,Offline,You want to compete with you. I think any team would like to compete with other Or our team.
P15,00:01:07,T4,Second,Offline,"I know right, they're just really want to compete with our team."
P14,00:01:10,T4,Second,Offline,"Which is like a competition that I am and I'm not really into competition. This is not somethiong I realy like But when there is a competition another people are competing with me with us, I guess we need to compare that."
P15,00:01:24,T4,Second,Offline,"It's just we could work across teams, but it's such a different idea probably because they're working with different ideas right now and we're working completely different ideas"
P14,00:01:37,T4,Second,Offline,Do you know what kind of ideas do they have?
P15,00:01:37,T4,Second,Offline,"Because I'm pretty sure they've already decided how we're going to go with the project. So if we do work across teams will not be able to cope up both the teams will be like, we should you should change this or you should change that."
P14,00:01:51,T4,Second,Offline,I don't think that they actually would like to I don't know. I think they would like to know what and to not cooperate with us.
P15,00:01:59,T4,Second,Offline,That's why I suggested in the very first meeting.
P14,00:02:01,T4,Second,Offline,Yes
P15,00:02:01,T4,Second,Offline,I was saying that we don't want to work together. We just want to divide all the projects between the teams rather than having to work both the things together.
P14,00:02:09,T4,Second,Offline,That's why you thought of something to be a good idea.
P15,00:02:12,T4,Second,Offline,"It's  not gonna be a good idea, it won't be a good idea. We should't be working acress teams a cometion is a bit. This work better just makes it work harder"
P14,00:02:20,T4,Second,Offline,Yes.
P15,00:02:21,T4,Second,Offline,"Anyway, have you decided to use a new technology to us? If so, is it concerning?"
P14,00:02:30,T4,Second,Offline,I think much said we can use react.
P15,00:02:32,T4,Second,Offline,Yes. I was looking at angular as well. So I think there has to be some new technologies reactor from.
P14,00:02:39,T4,Second,Offline,Just what for the challenge right?
P15,00:02:40,T4,Second,Offline,"No, I think react is going to be very important in a way to make it easier for us to make the application."
P14,00:02:48,T4,Second,Offline,"Okay, so we actually need to use it."
P15,00:02:50,T4,Second,Offline,Not need because I looked at the app it is good to use it because reactors is very helpful. I have read about it. I have no idea what it does. I have no idea What angular does I have very little clue about JavaScript and jQuery. I know how to use them. But anything more detailed is just not want to do it. But I think if Matt says that react might be important that it probably is
P14,00:03:17,T4,Second,Offline,"I think because it's a new technology that I don't know. You don't know most of the most of the things we don't know what I think that if we need to have more time for that to read about it to understand it and then to actually yeah, so yeah."
P15,00:03:35,T4,Second,Offline,"Well, you know, that's why I want that's what I want the team to be like in the lab every Wednesday and like as much time as possible together."
P14,00:03:45,T4,Second,Offline,"Have you seen? Oh, no, you weren't there last last last week on Wednesday. We had our meeting in here"
P15,00:03:53,T4,Second,Offline,Yeah. I'm sorry. I came late Young and Ole were there when I came in.
P14,00:04:01,T4,Second,Offline,"Yeah, I already have left, but the other team was staying just next to us and they were all together with their laptops and actually coding"
P15,00:04:08,T4,Second,Offline,"Yeah, that's what I want to do together. I want to talk together."
P14,00:04:11,T4,Second,Offline,"Yes, so it's not like they're working from home and I can't come now I have deadlines, they all gather together and they they'd write code they could like still working together. So you can't something they can't really say I'm not I don't have time. I hadn't realized you have to do."
P15,00:04:28,T4,Second,Offline,"You have to do it, you can't. I think Wednesday has to be a day where you come in we all sit together and we code and because half of us are not that experience, I mean the only reason I suggested the let's go with everyone making their own page for now. It's about we have something done. If I said that no we have to come in and code everything. Everyone would have been like just like no and too lazy and we can't do it. So at least we have something now that we have something now, we have to be strict with ourselves that hey we have to come in and we have to get it done and it has to be like because Matt has the most experience with JavaScript I think so he has to like that's why I suggested the you know, the repair repair coding thing case Okay, so that's why I suggesred pair programing and that's why this is just that let's have that. Let's have two people working on thing. So one person can learn while the other person does the coding as well. So that should help and I think that's what we should like talk about in like to chat today. Once we're done with everything that would have to do today. First of all. Yeah. I mean, we'll discuss that after this but yeah, we have to like it's concerning because to us a lot of these Technologies are new but two of the team members, it's not really that new"
P14,00:05:51,T4,Second,Offline,"I have experience with HTML and CSS, but with JavaScript no."
P15,00:05:55,T4,Second,Offline,"JavaScript nothing. Yeah, it's the same thing is the same without them only as well JavaScript jQuery. Not much experience HTML CSS. You don't need that much experience. You need to sit down and do it. But they're also very annoying to do okay for how are you finding the behavior of our customers?"
P14,00:06:13,T4,Second,Offline,I think you should say something about that... no no you should say something
P15,00:06:15,T4,Second,Offline,I know you have a lot to say about that Ivelina.
P14,00:06:21,T4,Second,Offline,"Yes. It's true, but I perfer to not to"
P15,00:06:25,T4,Second,Offline,He's very nice.
P14,00:06:32,T4,Second,Offline,True.
P15,00:06:33,T4,Second,Offline,If he's very nice look he mails us and every time he emails me. He says good luck with your this week's thingy. So I'm like he's very nice. But he's also like he's not very helpful in programming part is he? A lot of teams have like software teams working with them like people talking to them how everything works how everything is going and how.
P14,00:06:58,T4,Second,Offline,They actually help them like.
P15,00:07:01,T4,Second,Offline,"And we're just going blind. Yeah, you know, your project is simple."
P14,00:07:05,T4,Second,Offline,I think this is one of the issues that we can actually state in our dissertation in the vacation.
P15,00:07:11,T4,Second,Offline,This will be a big issue. You remember our very first meeting we were like this will be the very first issue that we should say that our client was not as responsive as
P14,00:07:21,T4,Second,Offline,And hopefully less
P15,00:07:22,T4,Second,Offline,Helpful or it has knowledgeable in the software line as other teams or or even on average decline had no idea what we were doing. So that's going to be our main point. I think very few other teams have that point a lot of other teams have knowledgeable client software companies that they're working on it. So that's going to be our main point. We were working with a very difficult client.
P14,00:07:46,T4,Second,Offline,It's true and that's our greatest challenge.
P15,00:07:50,T4,Second,Offline,"Yeah, the behavior of client behavior of the customer is just I mean, it's not bad but it's not very helpful. It's not helpful that much which is going blind. We're trying to do everything from the ground up. So that's that's difficult."
P14,00:08:05,T4,Second,Offline,Sometimes we're trying to explain him something about the program. He just doesn't think he doesn't want us there. That's not good.
P15,00:08:19,T4,Second,Offline,"All right. Number five-- how are we finding our coaches useful? Come on, get answer someone."
P14,00:08:24,T4,Second,Offline,I asked him last week about some help with the wiki and I still don't have that. So I just asked him again. He said yeah well next week but this is progressing and I can really make the Wikia out because they just need I don't want just to make something. I just want to make it as as as as perfect as possible. So that's why I need some examples of need some help. Yes. I'm still waiting.
P15,00:08:52,T4,Second,Offline,He's kind of lazy.
P14,00:08:53,T4,Second,Offline,"Yeah, he's he's little lazy. He didn't show up and he didn't scan up, which then a friend told me that this can be a problem for us to get points if we are not scanned and only I was scanned I think were you scanned?"
P15,00:09:07,T4,Second,Offline,No.
P14,00:09:08,T4,Second,Offline,"Only I was can because they went to Tim and I said looked Tim can you scan me because we were made me throwing Windows building and our coach wasn't there and he was like, you should definitely see your coach every week and now I he changes he changed his schedule or hold up. We were actually see him every week and you'll be able to ask questions."
P15,00:09:29,T4,Second,Offline,But we need to be here every week.
P14,00:09:32,T4,Second,Offline,As well. Yes.
P15,00:09:33,T4,Second,Offline,"Every one ever has to be. Yeah, I'm gonna be like, I'm just waiting for Monday because I've been spending all my time doing the algorithmic stuff as well. So I'm just waiting for Monday and I'm just going to be horrible because when people don't do their stuff, I'm horrible horrible leader when people don't do what they're supposed to do. Anyway, have you changed the structure of the team yet? If so how and why? I mean we haven't really changed anything."
P14,00:10:00,T4,Second,Offline,The structure of the team? Like team roles?
P15,00:10:01,T4,Second,Offline,"I mean because team roles, yeah because you can't do that. We can like over the course of the project we can change team roles exactly like someone's not doing as well as something we can change the roles that's like things some type of management tightly defined. In the lectures, so we haven't really changed anything."
P14,00:10:22,T4,Second,Offline,No
P15,00:10:22,T4,Second,Offline,We have basically just defined the team roles.
P14,00:10:25,T4,Second,Offline,"Yeah, and I think that everyone to his role very like."
P15,00:10:29,T4,Second,Offline,"We went through a very rigorous process. I don't think anyone did like, hey, let's have a democratic vote."
P14,00:10:37,T4,Second,Offline,"No no, no. No, they were like I can do this. I can do let's make another votes."
P15,00:10:49,T4,Second,Offline,"We have voted for everything, haven't we? We have voted for everything. That's how we know that everyone's doing something that they know how to do it because Jan's handling all the Crazy stuff that no one else wants handle. Matt is doing like not is the team leader and like most sensitive. I don't remember I tried not to get his for I tried not to give anyone four but then I think one of the votes had only in it so someone has four roles."
P14,00:11:26,T4,Second,Offline,Yes
P15,00:11:26,T4,Second,Offline,"That's what I was a problem, but I couldn't do anything. That's how votes went."
P15,00:11:29,T4,Second,Offline,"Oh, he's discussing with your customers or is he a toolsmith as well?"
P14,00:11:36,T4,Second,Offline,I think he a secound toolsmith
P15,00:11:41,T4,Second,Offline,"I'm a quality assurance. Team leader, what else is not doing? I think I think II tester."
P14,00:11:54,T4,Second,Offline,Isn't that Jan.
P15,00:11:55,T4,Second,Offline,"Only it's all Jan. I don't know. I remember anyways, but I think the team says goes well if we feel like changing it afterwards we'll talk about that later."
P14,00:12:06,T4,Second,Offline,"I think when we did that vote at the end everything everyone was like, oh I was happy with the.."
P15,00:12:13,T4,Second,Offline,Almost happy.
P14,00:12:14,T4,Second,Offline,"With the result and that's why I think no one just said, okay. I don't like this at all."
P15,00:12:19,T4,Second,Offline,I kind of knew what kind of role would come out like It's gonna be like this. It's gonna be kind of toolSmith everyone knew Jan gonna be to toolSmith.
P14,00:12:30,T4,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P15,00:12:31,T4,Second,Offline,I think you got the most website or anything. Quality assurance was something that could have been anyone librarian. I wasn't sure I don't think I voted for you. I was like
P14,00:12:44,T4,Second,Offline,I'm happy because I didn't want to be librarian.
P15,00:12:46,T4,Second,Offline,"I knew I knew that like when we were talking about the wiki and stuff I could see your face you didn't want to do that. So I'm like I shouldn't vote for her and I think I voted for you as Quality assurance. But for the librarian, I think I voted for Ole for this. Anyway, the team roles are pretty good, right now"
P14,00:12:57,T4,Second,Offline,The Strature look good and everone is doing well.
P15,00:12:57,T4,Second,Offline,That's it right?
P14,00:12:57,T4,Second,Offline,Yes
P4,00:00:31,T1,Second,Offline,Are we concerned about the scope of the project?  No.
P1,00:00:38,T1,Second,Offline,You think until next weekend is not enough?
P4,00:00:42,T1,Second,Offline,You are.
P1,00:00:42,T1,Second,Offline,"Oh, because it's not enough."
P1,00:01:01,T1,Second,Offline,"So yeah, because under the scope of the project. I think that's all we can say about I want yes, they have to work across teams. No, not really."
P4,00:01:15,T1,Second,Offline,"We do we do after we talked with the other teams, aren't we?"
P1,00:01:15,T1,Second,Offline,"Alright, yeah"
P2,00:01:15,T1,Second,Offline,"I was thinking the samllest we can as I was driving over and they are going to have to login and stuff and use like an API for their app, but there's there's kinda like half an API in the server and just because the way the games were to my stuff so potentially will be like modifying the same code to change that into a more full fledged API. Well, they'll want to do that was like, I don't know what they can try an offload it on us if we you know, we're done in two weeks and it's kind of thing to do for us of you."
P5,00:01:57,T1,Second,Offline,But isn't that API for the games specifically and rather not?
P2,00:02:00,T1,Second,Offline,"It's the same thing though. The lady authentication has its own API, which is just running on its own."
P5,00:02:08,T1,Second,Offline,Yeah
P2,00:02:09,T1,Second,Offline,Well that's just seems to think the whole thing's pretty much written as a rest API. So potentially that just be expanding man.
P5,00:02:24,T1,Second,Offline,So we have to work acoress teams. Maybe actually. Why they wanted that on meeting zone.
P2,00:02:29,T1,Second,Offline,"Yeah, it was well, obviously that mean they might not want to touch it."
P5,00:02:34,T1,Second,Offline,"So yeah, have you decided to use a new technology?"
P4,00:02:43,T1,Second,Offline,"Yes, docker was some really a decision right now is we haven't decided to scrap everything to something we know so yeah."
P5,00:02:53,T1,Second,Offline,So the angular JavaScript there's that see C Sharp there's a unity and then there's docker. As a concern against a lot that's a lot of things but we're just modifying it mostly and so if we can touch the existing pool to stuff like that happen easier than think it is.
P1,00:03:16,T1,Second,Offline,Are we going to use non-Jess?
P2,00:03:18,T1,Second,Offline,Just some kind of have to just because it's already in there.
P5,00:03:23,T1,Second,Offline,"And next one, how do we find the behavior of our customers?"
P4,00:03:28,T1,Second,Offline,They really don't know they want.
P5,00:03:30,T1,Second,Offline,"Yeah, the requirements are benefit and then the people that we could contact for email this life the holiday."
P3,00:03:35,T1,Second,Offline,We can be on Wednesday at 10:30 if you want because I emailed him before I knew that. Times were like creative scheduled. So I don't feel wanna meet with them beforehand. I think it might be kind of a waste of their time though. It will be the same information.
P5,00:03:57,T1,Second,Offline,I think we should prepare that off and then just for practice the slides of one up for then. So the layer of these slides they are the actual meeting the more we can actually just talk about this later - and make sure it's bigger before then.
P4,00:04:12,T1,Second,Offline,Sounds good.
P5,00:04:17,T1,Second,Offline,That's just my opinion. So next question. There's nothing else other than other bigger of our customers are located like in terms of actually wanting to be open they come whatever we have to be able to just give and stuff like that.
P3,00:04:32,T1,Second,Offline,They up to the uni?
P5,00:04:34,T1,Second,Offline,"Yeah, there're offset the uni. I think it's okay so far. It's more positives than I've heard of other teams."
P5,00:04:44,T1,Second,Offline,"Our finding our coaches useful? Yes, absolutely, especially with the comments and stuff like that."
P4,00:04:58,T1,Second,Offline,Most of a lot talking as well.
P5,00:05:00,T1,Second,Offline,"Yeah, and then presentation is over there. You don't know shit. Are we changing the structure of the team yet? I still haven't why structure of the team? Is that the rules?"
P4,00:05:15,T1,Second,Offline,We can make rules. So yeah
P5,00:05:16,T1,Second,Offline,"Just yeah, we just did that recently making him. So we haven't decided to change in my own."
P4,00:05:21,T1,Second,Offline,I just as a change the structure was that we had no structure.
P5,00:05:26,T1,Second,Offline,"Yeah, but if so have't why? Just what the rules do we have again? Chief Architect and project manager."
P2,00:05:41,T1,Second,Offline,That's what I come up with.
P1,00:05:44,T1,Second,Offline,No fear.
P2,00:06:15,T1,Second,Offline,I can imagine it becoming a bit more fluid as we get more into it anyway.
P1,00:06:19,T1,Second,Offline,Test manager.
P2,00:06:20,T1,Second,Offline,Test manager nice
P4,00:06:22,T1,Second,Offline,You guys is quality assurance and Customer liaison
P3,00:06:25,T1,Second,Offline,"No, I changed that."
P4,00:06:26,T1,Second,Offline,Did you?
P3,00:06:26,T1,Second,Offline,To a Secretariat. Women's role.
P4,00:06:26,T1,Second,Offline,Which has not been changed.
P4,00:06:36,T1,Second,Offline,Because I'm just going to be sec as well
P5,00:06:38,T1,Second,Offline,Oh was it?
P4,00:06:42,T1,Second,Offline,"No, Dom wants to be a secretariat. I don't know where he is now."
P2,00:06:44,T1,Second,Offline,There is version.
P1,00:06:48,T1,Second,Offline,Whatever the last message.
P2,00:06:50,T1,Second,Offline,That's not shown it's searched because this is really about the conversation.
P1,00:06:54,T1,Second,Offline,I think last message was from Dom.
P3,00:06:56,T1,Second,Offline,Yeah.
P2,00:06:58,T1,Second,Offline,"I didn't write some roles and names, so I don't know what would happen"
P4,00:07:07,T1,Second,Offline,It defines your name as it said this conversation.
P5,00:07:23,T1,Second,Offline,"Yeah, Sam's to Smith."
P4,00:07:34,T1,Second,Offline,Are you quality assurant?
P5,00:07:39,T1,Second,Offline,And that's a nice.
P2,00:07:42,T1,Second,Offline,That's all the questions I have if we we stopped.
P5,00:07:46,T1,Second,Offline,Do you have anything more to say?
P1,00:07:49,T1,Second,Offline,Well so much yesterday's until the next meeting. We can't get anything in more detail yet. Until we actually start working on codes and stuff like that.
P4,00:08:03,T1,Second,Offline,That's it.
P29,00:00:06,T7,Third,Offline,"I've already got some ideas for you did with one of them was mentioned. We should get thing posted like that knowing where or something and the second one was we have got to figure out how to actually get this you chances to work with multiple instances because the moment is only one chat room. I mean, I guess I'll be my job."
P32,00:00:28,T7,Third,Offline,Do you think that's important for the next iteration?
P29,00:00:31,T7,Third,Offline,I mean to be when you say the next do you mean the one on Wednesday?
P32,00:00:34,T7,Third,Offline,I mean the fifth of December  to 23rd of January.
P31,00:00:42,T7,Third,Offline,No the one after that. We're finished.
P29,00:00:45,T7,Third,Offline,No no that's he means. The one after this is the one she's talking about.
P31,00:01:05,T7,Third,Offline,I'm just looking at the PowerPoint slides for next meeting which is.
P29,00:01:07,T7,Third,Offline,Something you mean I start already?
P31,00:01:11,T7,Third,Offline,No like I'm just you just like made a copy of the old one. This is up not was just like copying passage.
P32,00:01:16,T7,Third,Offline,It Was pretty similar.
P29,00:01:27,T7,Third,Offline,I really like the design of the thing.
P31,00:01:37,T7,Third,Offline,The thing goes like the shade?
P32,00:01:40,T7,Third,Offline,I don't like the shade.
P31,00:01:41,T7,Third,Offline,"No, but not by much the shape like the whole like."
P32,00:01:43,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah. It was really good like.
P29,00:01:46,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah. I know we should keep that for the next one as well.
P31,00:01:48,T7,Third,Offline,"Anyway, so yeah, I think deploying on Python was very important."
P32,00:01:53,T7,Third,Offline,The only problem was I think they mentioned in our piece is partially protected I think in JavaScript and python anywhere?
P29,00:01:59,T7,Third,Offline,What? How?
P32,00:01:59,T7,Third,Offline,I don't know they just say like.
P29,00:02:03,T7,Third,Offline,Did they create the JavaScript on the web developer thing?
P29,00:02:05,T7,Third,Offline,He just mention a problem with python - anywhere and to try something else.
P31,00:02:11,T7,Third,Offline,Like some data.
P29,00:02:12,T7,Third,Offline,No the that report on the article about the person that we did speak messenger chat bot.
P31,00:02:19,T7,Third,Offline,Oh.
P29,00:02:19,T7,Third,Offline,I I think the was the first link on their repository.
P32,00:02:23,T7,Third,Offline,I don't how it could be possible.
P32,00:02:27,T7,Third,Offline,I know I just remember her saying something with Python anywhere.
P29,00:02:30,T7,Third,Offline,"This alternative to Python anyway, As well as Tim mentioned. It is not a problem we can get it done whichever way anyway, yeah, that was all I could think of to talk about this."
P31,00:02:45,T7,Third,Offline,It's just a - anyone doesn't support Java dependencies like Stanford core NLTK. But we were going to use Python natural language processing libraries rather than the Stanford like the Java dependency right?
P29,00:03:02,T7,Third,Offline,Awesome. Yeah. I mean sure I haven't given much thought to what package.
P31,00:03:05,T7,Third,Offline,I mean both.
P29,00:03:06,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah I thought I put Sanford on the presentation with it's not like they're gonna like a search engine.
P32,00:03:13,T7,Third,Offline,Like was even there the last time so.
P29,00:03:14,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P31,00:03:16,T7,Third,Offline,"What we want to write this so Deploy on - anywhere. Well, I really think we should look into is how we want to structure the database. So right now like it's kind of hard not hard coded it say but like I had to do quite a few like work around just because the way the data is done. Yeah, so this is basically it takes all the fields are already in in the Excel. So if there's any time you don't want we can remove them and stuff, but just there was a lot of work around this time of like like the general courses admissions data. We like sometimes the like what supposed to be a single codes like there's a duplicate because it changes from one year to the next."
P32,00:04:12,T7,Third,Offline,No
P31,00:04:12,T7,Third,Offline,So I had to like make it work around and add like the added to you was running to the codes that like the primary code which is a good as a primary key. So it would be unique.
P32,00:04:24,T7,Third,Offline,Do you just make another two cells? I had zero or one that is just making billions.
P31,00:04:28,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah
P29,00:04:29,T7,Third,Offline,I wasn't writing or anything about the last client meeting. I said that we have like a thing where no matter what Excel valuable in it could automatically.
P31,00:04:41,T7,Third,Offline,I Know
P29,00:04:43,T7,Third,Offline,I mean do you think like not possible with this?
P31,00:04:45,T7,Third,Offline,I don't think it's I don't think it's impossible that depends on how we
P32,00:04:51,T7,Third,Offline,One of the things that I was wondering about the database is you know how to filter short courses are lined to the length of the day. So for them to say can you tell me about short courses all are we having.
P31,00:05:03,T7,Third,Offline,So I wasn't supposed to put all of them in.
P32,00:05:06,T7,Third,Offline,No no you were.
P31,00:05:06,T7,Third,Offline,Okay
P32,00:05:07,T7,Third,Offline,But let's say it's when I was thinking about our courses shoot. They should the things they okay Charlie equals jury single day or should we have like a variable or something that says that this is a short course ?
P31,00:05:19,T7,Third,Offline,"No if it just what if its duration, but I thought I Fox will cause it could be longer than a day."
P32,00:05:24,T7,Third,Offline,"No, the folder was the only ones for a day. There are some courses at last to a week now."
P31,00:05:30,T7,Third,Offline,That's why couldn't that be in database?
P32,00:05:34,T7,Third,Offline,"No, It should be in the database, but it shouldn't be it's not considered short course."
P31,00:05:37,T7,Third,Offline,Why it might be not considered a shot course?
P32,00:05:37,T7,Third,Offline,"It's not short enough, I think"
P29,00:05:37,T7,Third,Offline,One of my courses like last three months.
P32,00:05:45,T7,Third,Offline,"Yeah, there's lots of those like ones at last a day a week a month and then like a term in year."
P29,00:05:50,T7,Third,Offline,So that's gonna be the problem because somebody asked this already said things like the short cause and they ask it like short is for this. I don't know
P31,00:06:00,T7,Third,Offline,"I think, is it okay for you if you excuse me?"
P32,00:06:01,T7,Third,Offline,Thanks.
P31,00:06:05,T7,Third,Offline,"And right now you can't put in a any any Excel thing, like it basically takes I've made it to be able to read like if you see what I've made it to be able to read like the Excel sheet that we were given for admissions and the Excel sheet that we were given for thing. But as I said, like I was I was wondering if we should put everything in like course and then like this side like on feels that we would have to pull but then you'd have to like look into like I think you still have to know where the data structure of the thing originally."
P29,00:06:38,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P32,00:06:39,T7,Third,Offline,"Well, I wasn't sure if like I'm saying stuff but like we could also have a load. He was just coarser just make like course called course name like something that all courses have."
P31,00:06:49,T7,Third,Offline,"Yeah, that's what I'm saying."
P32,00:06:52,T7,Third,Offline,And then have sub tables.
P31,00:06:54,T7,Third,Offline,Sub tables do you mean just other tables that you have relationships to?
P32,00:06:58,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P31,00:07:00,T7,Third,Offline,That's what I'm talking about.
P29,00:07:01,T7,Third,Offline,Did you get followed the research on what was released because I can still show you today?
P32,00:07:08,T7,Third,Offline,"Yeah, I Okay, there's two things what I want you to go through with me everything done so far. So I'm like a peach behind I think so. I just want to make sure on the same page."
P29,00:07:22,T7,Third,Offline,What what I've done you don't really need to know much apart from the fact that there's two functions which you guys should probably only use you to use anything of what I've touched one is message received and sending message.
P31,00:07:37,T7,Third,Offline,I looked at the goods quite simple.
P32,00:07:39,T7,Third,Offline,"Yeah, I looked at the code also. Those one of the things I was interested when into a function, you know, where you have to like do like like like is it something BR plus this plus that just pushed me can learn to function."
P29,00:07:50,T7,Third,Offline,I just put the one we are using in a bold.
P31,00:07:51,T7,Third,Offline,Maybe maybe don't like We should change this from the best.
P32,00:07:57,T7,Third,Offline,"Yeah. Well, I only did it so it would something like work but we  you guys know what happened."
P31,00:08:03,T7,Third,Offline,"So right now what we have is a chat interface that can send and receive message for at least one session and we have the database that has all but these are they can pull through but it's not very much lower because I still need to make some things like right now if we change any Fields, I need to like delete the database and then remake it but I just need to look into that version because I wanted that like kept telling me we have we have you met a lot of detectives for this Activation. So we're not everything we do is just like."
P29,00:08:36,T7,Third,Offline,Apart from the actual ball talking to us.
P31,00:08:39,T7,Third,Offline,What do you mean?
P29,00:08:39,T7,Third,Offline,"Well, it's got this kind of got to give you some basic questions or something for the product."
P31,00:08:44,T7,Third,Offline,"I mean, they have given us a basic responses"
P32,00:08:55,T7,Third,Offline,Before I was just thinking like if you just say Emma just has an energy like just so you know something an image.
P29,00:09:01,T7,Third,Offline,"Oh, yeah now be cool if we could like bring it up and just show it to them."
P32,00:09:06,T7,Third,Offline,"Yeah, but it's not like we can definitely that for Wednesday."
P31,00:09:10,T7,Third,Offline,I think we could.
P29,00:09:10,T7,Third,Offline,The cool the cool thing about the what we have so far is that even if we don't get the chat bot running we can like fake it.
P32,00:09:18,T7,Third,Offline,You just totally question exactly how we're wanted.
P29,00:09:21,T7,Third,Offline,In the message received and sent message. You just say give the user set this they just reply yo this.
P31,00:09:29,T7,Third,Offline,Look into having multiple sessions for the chat bot.
P32,00:09:40,T7,Third,Offline,Or we can worry about how much you're going to focus on accuracy of the language progressing.
P31,00:09:46,T7,Third,Offline,We need to stop thinking like we need to start actually doing NLP. Mohamed sent me some codes that he wanted to show us.
P29,00:09:54,T7,Third,Offline,Did he get hit back on the way here or something because it's like almost 25 passed?
P31,00:09:58,T7,Third,Offline,I don't know
P29,00:09:58,T7,Third,Offline,Has he measured the chat?
P31,00:10:03,T7,Third,Offline,No
P29,00:10:03,T7,Third,Offline,"What did he send you, sorry?"
P31,00:10:03,T7,Third,Offline,So he sent me two things he sent me a code that's like a chat bot. I don't know. This is defiantly copy and past it.
P29,00:10:29,T7,Third,Offline,It's from the article. I remember I that code.
P31,00:10:31,T7,Third,Offline,Okay.
P29,00:10:31,T7,Third,Offline,"Yeah, it's from the article that we all liked. But that's that looks like it would work for our fake prototypes and then he sent me a thing for parsing and this is more like him writing anything because."
P29,00:10:43,T7,Third,Offline,"Default. Okay,."
P31,00:10:51,T7,Third,Offline,He used like Spacey.
P29,00:10:53,T7,Third,Offline,We should get into start writing the test.
P31,00:10:58,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P29,00:10:58,T7,Third,Offline,Because that's something we should have confident with.
P31,00:11:01,T7,Third,Offline,With the the build pipeline as well. Like he can make it check that when you run the code at least there's no error in the output.
P29,00:11:12,T7,Third,Offline,That's cool. How he did run the code though.
P32,00:11:18,T7,Third,Offline,No you can just make it run like different things. It's like the same thing as what you have currently.
P29,00:11:25,T7,Third,Offline,Okay.
P31,00:11:26,T7,Third,Offline,The green-eyed does PDF latex with I've imagined people like Python 3 main or Pi or like pattern for every GDB and stuff.
P29,00:11:32,T7,Third,Offline,But it will only it would only test for things as soon as it starts up like it come like could it actually interact with the web page and see what.
P31,00:11:39,T7,Third,Offline,I mean the managers are not  going to look into that this no said he would some stuff like sure stuff.
P29,00:12:02,T7,Third,Offline,"I'll take a look at what time was like, how is it going to here for?"
P31,00:12:07,T7,Third,Offline,I can stay but I need to eat so.
P29,00:12:10,T7,Third,Offline,I got to go three for something that I'll be back and I'll be there to like six or something so.
P31,00:12:16,T7,Third,Offline,I'm going to be working with not only this book. I need to catch up on my lectures and stuff.
P29,00:12:23,T7,Third,Offline,"I got to do my job tonight, but hopefully the chapel kind of working and then tomorrow, we hopefully we will get it done today be like props and presentation."
P31,00:12:31,T7,Third,Offline,I mean this isn't the best week for me.
P29,00:12:33,T7,Third,Offline,"The school library  ahead of like movie made some good progress. Obviously,."
P31,00:12:39,T7,Third,Offline,I'll work on the presentation as well like just a hand. It's not going to be hard
P32,00:12:45,T7,Third,Offline,If he wants to do it.
P31,00:12:45,T7,Third,Offline,I think it should be you and me just because he wanted to do it.
P32,00:12:49,T7,Third,Offline,How about me?
P31,00:12:49,T7,Third,Offline,Just because just because you did the chapel and I did the database.
P32,00:12:55,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah you but remember what we did before so if you can talk about what we did
P29,00:13:01,T7,Third,Offline,We could do it. If you do it three people one does draw a side one did what we want is what we did. What wonders what we'll do.
P31,00:13:08,T7,Third,Offline,"Yeah, like we both say what we did and then you can see what we're going to do."
P32,00:13:12,T7,Third,Offline,Or you can see what we did after the Prototype and as many questions about it.
P31,00:13:17,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P31,00:13:17,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P31,00:13:22,T7,Third,Offline,Are you just worried about not talking?
P32,00:13:24,T7,Third,Offline,"No, I just"
P29,00:13:28,T7,Third,Offline,I think it sounds should like.
P31,00:13:30,T7,Third,Offline,"I mean, it's just true in Prototype. It's okay. It's not like."
P32,00:13:34,T7,Third,Offline,It's gonna be more stuff than what we did.
P31,00:13:36,T7,Third,Offline,No he is he just going to type like.
P29,00:13:44,T7,Third,Offline,"Yeah, I will just type some data and press enter"
P32,00:13:44,T7,Third,Offline,It's fine. But like I don't really see how that's two people.
P29,00:13:48,T7,Third,Offline,It's not like it's not a big deal.
P32,00:13:53,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P29,00:13:53,T7,Third,Offline,Would you like to do all of it?
P32,00:13:56,T7,Third,Offline,No.
P29,00:13:56,T7,Third,Offline,I'm confused. Are you saying this to me?
P31,00:14:04,T7,Third,Offline,What's your issue?
P32,00:14:12,T7,Third,Offline,"No, it's fine."
P29,00:14:13,T7,Third,Offline,You sure.
P32,00:14:14,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah
P29,00:14:14,T7,Third,Offline,You think inaudible?
P31,00:14:16,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P32,00:14:16,T7,Third,Offline,"No, it's fine."
P29,00:14:17,T7,Third,Offline,"If you want if you want to do mind generally, it's not mine. It's not a big deal. Anything else you guys want to talk about?"
P31,00:14:30,T7,Third,Offline,I mean there was some Mohammed stuff that not his. So if anyone wants messaging to be like.
P29,00:14:42,T7,Third,Offline,I will do it
P29,00:14:42,T7,Third,Offline,I will message him.
P29,00:14:50,T7,Third,Offline,So you're going to come to that?
P32,00:14:52,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P29,00:14:53,T7,Third,Offline,Then you can show me what you've maybe.
P29,00:15:01,T7,Third,Offline,There he is
P29,00:15:01,T7,Third,Offline,No he stopped by when we finished our meeting
P33,00:15:01,T7,Third,Offline,"Sorry, sorry. I swear to God It will never happen again"
P31,00:15:11,T7,Third,Offline,You must owe us five pounds if it happens again.
P33,00:15:19,T7,Third,Offline,"Okay, that's fair actually."
P31,00:15:33,T7,Third,Offline,"So this your code, so if you want to talk to us about it"
P33,00:15:35,T7,Third,Offline,"First of all, I've seen senior code. So I think you've already done like printing the messages. Yeah, so I don't need to do that message thing like send the message. So what happened is just generating a respond to the message. That's what he's after Yeah. So basically it's I've been reading like wow a lot of things. So for now, we are just doing one response for."
P29,00:16:10,T7,Third,Offline,But no like a few responses both every.
P33,00:16:14,T7,Third,Offline,"I understand yeah, it's one respond for a message."
P29,00:16:18,T7,Third,Offline,Yes
P33,00:16:18,T7,Third,Offline,Because later on we're going to do a machine state machine state it's okay. I will explain it later.
P29,00:16:30,T7,Third,Offline,I mean what I have done the system I have already read State.
P33,00:16:34,T7,Third,Offline,What?
P29,00:16:34,T7,Third,Offline,The system I have already has a state system is user connected and then there's message sent must receive.
P33,00:16:40,T7,Third,Offline,"No, no. No, it's not about this one. The state machine should control the conversation. So a good chat book will mean that its control the conversation and it will gives options today user to ask something or a hint to ask something. You know? and that thing is actually in the database or the chat bot can answer."
P32,00:17:17,T7,Third,Offline,Can you give an example?
P33,00:17:17,T7,Third,Offline,"Yeah, so if he said he for example said can you find me a course outside Glasgow?"
P29,00:17:33,T7,Third,Offline,Why?
P33,00:17:32,T7,Third,Offline,Maybe this is just an example.
P31,00:17:37,T7,Third,Offline,Why outside Glasgow?.
P29,00:17:39,T7,Third,Offline,Do you mean outside Glasgow uni or ?
P33,00:17:41,T7,Third,Offline,Outside the Glasgow I would say.
P31,00:17:42,T7,Third,Offline,Why would they be able to do that? That's not the point of the bot.
P33,00:17:46,T7,Third,Offline,I know.
P32,00:17:46,T7,Third,Offline,Do remember we were doing to remember that  picture with the four squares?
P33,00:17:50,T7,Third,Offline,Was it?
P29,00:17:52,T7,Third,Offline,And single database.
P33,00:17:55,T7,Third,Offline,"I know I know I know if we're doing what you have. You have to be, you know to be ready for anything."
P29,00:18:01,T7,Third,Offline,"No. No, we don't need that."
P33,00:18:02,T7,Third,Offline,"It's not hard, trust me."
P32,00:18:03,T7,Third,Offline,You could like I don't know about this and that but it is supposed be close to what we asked about the subject.
P33,00:18:09,T7,Third,Offline,"So just just understand example, so what happens that it will goes to the James send message and come here to the where. Okay, response message after the response message. It will goes to the person thing. So the person is machine learning."
P29,00:18:33,T7,Third,Offline,"Wait, dose it is respond and parse it?"
P33,00:18:38,T7,Third,Offline,Actually.
P29,00:18:39,T7,Third,Offline,But just side of like it starts inside the function that goes to the parsing?
P33,00:18:43,T7,Third,Offline,"I did not complete the the respond thing. I have to include this one here, but because there's a lot of the respond will expand with time because we have to use maybe something like emotions and other stuff. So the person messages just like get the entities and the intents of the of the message and then pass enquiry to the yeah. It's part person quite a while and then to another function and this function will make the SQL query, you know, and pass it to the database so they can get the information. So if they said okay, we need a course. I need a course outside of Glasgow. So unfortunately, there is no entities called outside Glasgow. So what happen is that it will goes. Sorry. I don't have I don't have this."
P32,00:19:55,T7,Third,Offline,"I don't think our  machine will know that because we don't all over had have like a room location. We don't have like like it to say. Oh, it's so long. It's yeah, we haven't for me to this time. Like I just feel like this it seemed like all into them. So you rushing I feel like that would the easier thing."
P33,00:20:14,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah. Well what happened is that it will take you Glasgow as a location and it will search inside the.
P33,00:20:22,T7,Third,Offline,I don't know if you need to worry about locations.
P31,00:20:25,T7,Third,Offline,"No, why would you worry about location?"
P33,00:20:24,T7,Third,Offline,"I'm not worrying about the vacation just the way how it's going to be like if for example if the data I don't know if the database has a location then it will take a look location, but if it doesn't has a location that will occur."
P31,00:20:40,T7,Third,Offline,"Why you are worried about the location, that's not even in the bot?"
P33,00:20:42,T7,Third,Offline,"No, no."
P29,00:20:44,T7,Third,Offline,The example you gave makes like little sense. But the code which I'm reading here sounds but it looks quite interesting.
P33,00:20:50,T7,Third,Offline,"Hmm. By the way, there is a lot of English in this there's a lot of English."
P29,00:20:54,T7,Third,Offline,Ideally.
P31,00:20:56,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P29,00:20:56,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P31,00:20:56,T7,Third,Offline,What do you mean by there's a lot of English?
P33,00:20:59,T7,Third,Offline,So I'm using spacy here. So especially is the library that include like Words in English and all other languages like Arabic Chinese so and it has Victor's word Victor's with 300 dimensions.
P29,00:21:28,T7,Third,Offline,That bot is talking Chinese?
P33,00:21:30,T7,Third,Offline,"Absolutely no, absolutely. no, I don't know I Chinese. So the thing is just we're learning just English here."
P32,00:21:38,T7,Third,Offline,"Okay, remember also that you're testing it. So if you did want to include all those languages,."
P33,00:21:42,T7,Third,Offline,"Absolutely, I will not that."
P31,00:21:44,T7,Third,Offline,I think we should go bit by bit and understand
P33,00:21:44,T7,Third,Offline,"Yeah, this is this is basic thing. Trust me. Trust me."
P32,00:21:51,T7,Third,Offline,How is this is basic?
P29,00:21:51,T7,Third,Offline,"So Spacy is an NLP library, right?"
P33,00:21:51,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P29,00:21:56,T7,Third,Offline,Okay cool and you just specifically use the English.
P33,00:22:03,T7,Third,Offline,"So and then basically I'm using a dataset from a free dataset location in GitHub. So those people have made the free data set and for business, but I'm not sure if they include courses if they don't include courses than that, we have to do our dataset thing like all things nobody, but hopefully hopefully hopefully it's included there dataset it means the words course synonym for these courses stuff like that and there's another way to avoid using these but these are the data set thing is the most efficient thing we could also do some way called the nearest neighbour. It's also the nearest neighbour is just like figuring out which intense is the you know, the most high required thing and that once it figured out if he goes maybe another entities, for example, if like I want to fly from Paris to I have to make it simpler."
P31,00:23:36,T7,Third,Offline,Why you're flying?
P33,00:23:36,T7,Third,Offline,Just just.
P29,00:23:37,T7,Third,Offline,Just an example
P33,00:23:37,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah fly from Paris to maybe you're to Edinburgh. So what happened is that it will catch fly and it will say fly search search for flight.
P29,00:23:51,T7,Third,Offline,Okay.
P33,00:23:51,T7,Third,Offline,"Okay, and I will take Edinburgh and Paris as entities."
P29,00:23:56,T7,Third,Offline,Okay.
P33,00:23:58,T7,Third,Offline,"So, yeah, so this is another way but this way I think it's more convenient with us because it doesn't show everything and we trained that we train our chat bot and we pass here the entity's as I said that passing the entities to the query maker and that this one pass it to some other method will take the information from the database. This is going to be easy. I'm not worried too much about it. But once we have you know everything you know, it connected the database we will be fine."
P31,00:24:54,T7,Third,Offline,The database is connected
P33,00:24:56,T7,Third,Offline,"Cool, awesome."
P31,00:24:57,T7,Third,Offline,I can show you how to use it on the tutorials. I in the previous.
P33,00:25:04,T7,Third,Offline,Have you slept?
P31,00:25:04,T7,Third,Offline,What?
P33,00:25:04,T7,Third,Offline,You seem like awake.
P33,00:25:04,T7,Third,Offline,No I just had a bad day.
P29,00:25:05,T7,Third,Offline,"Bad day,  it's only"
P33,00:25:05,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah 12 hours.
P31,00:25:12,T7,Third,Offline,So if you go on the git I added a readme for the database that.
P29,00:25:24,T7,Third,Offline,"Once I can get access to the database, I think that's it."
P31,00:25:31,T7,Third,Offline,What?
P33,00:25:31,T7,Third,Offline,Once if we connected to the the function I think that's it.
P31,00:25:37,T7,Third,Offline,"So you just if you're going to it's already on the VM, but if you're gonna use it on your own machine, this is what you need to stop and then this is how you."
P33,00:25:48,T7,Third,Offline,Install it on the VM.
P31,00:25:50,T7,Third,Offline,"This is already on the VM, but if you want to install it on your machine, You can't use it on the machine and then there's like what I used so like SQL change for also, it has some like queries as well. Actually, I don't know but this one and it shows you how he can query for stuff. It's basically just like if you use MySQL connector, which were going to use at the beginning you need to type out all the queries and this is just basically translate the queries into Python language. So instead of like so it just like those classes are not."
P33,00:26:29,T7,Third,Offline,I think most of our queries.
P31,00:26:32,T7,Third,Offline,For example like this would be the SQL query and this is how it looks in SQL tree.
P33,00:26:39,T7,Third,Offline,But I think most of our functions would be like select.
P31,00:26:45,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P33,00:26:46,T7,Third,Offline,From where it's like.
P31,00:26:54,T7,Third,Offline,This is what I showed you. You can use that. So you obviously can look into that if you show me like if you like if you want me to write if you want something.
P33,00:27:01,T7,Third,Offline,I think I can do it like in two hours.
P29,00:27:04,T7,Third,Offline,I would worry about the actual Chat bot code.
P33,00:27:08,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P29,00:27:08,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah. I think you should stop right now on the test.
P31,00:27:11,T7,Third,Offline,The testing.
P29,00:27:11,T7,Third,Offline,Because there's a lot to know for the testing. Let's get it to work and everything.
P33,00:27:15,T7,Third,Offline,A work this is going to take like I think that this function will take like an hour and then
P31,00:27:23,T7,Third,Offline,What do you mean by this function?
P33,00:27:24,T7,Third,Offline,Making the query a thing.
P31,00:27:27,T7,Third,Offline,I have been doing this because I already know how the database works and how it's structured if it's like I can obviously teach you but for the iteration getting into work for one query for to for like example.
P32,00:27:37,T7,Third,Offline,"Yeah, and I'll take the chat bot code and get it to work with the interface."
P31,00:27:40,T7,Third,Offline,So if you can look into like build pipelines and.
P29,00:27:43,T7,Third,Offline,"Yeah, you're basically done for the situation so you can start testing."
P33,00:27:47,T7,Third,Offline,Okay. Just I have to tell you something about the next iteration. So in the next iterations for the project for the chat bot thing we have to create patterns.
P32,00:28:03,T7,Third,Offline,Patterns for what?
P33,00:28:04,T7,Third,Offline,"Yeah, I'm telling you. So patterns is something that is like an expression in regular expression plan exactly what they are. So when when for example someone says oh Sam do you remember my birthday ? This pattern like do you remember this is a pattern or phrase the chat bot could learn this thing."
P32,00:28:38,T7,Third,Offline,I don't think they should learn them.
P33,00:28:39,T7,Third,Offline,"I know I know but not this one not this one. This is just an example, but we need a phrases that it's close to the business. You see. So whatever is like it close to the business should be known."
P32,00:28:54,T7,Third,Offline,Might be close to the business.
P33,00:28:55,T7,Third,Offline,"How much is this? Does it include in the past? It's a phrase though. So we have to include it and the Machine is that thing that I wanted to talk about first is how to control a conversation so we can have a policy for the chat button. The first is like starting the conversation to State his greeting. Okay, and then once we finish greeting we move to the next state machine, so it's going to be a long long journey because we cannot we're gonna spend more and more of the the state thing and the patterns stuff and also the random responses for the chat bot. For example,."
P32,00:29:53,T7,Third,Offline,What do you mean by random?
P33,00:29:54,T7,Third,Offline,If say if for example if he said hi.
P32,00:30:00,T7,Third,Offline,You can say hi back.
P33,00:30:02,T7,Third,Offline,"or hello, and this is random thing."
P32,00:30:07,T7,Third,Offline,I feel like as long as it's a little you just say hello. I don't think like there's not I don't think what we think hey or how the or anything like that so that's it.
P29,00:30:15,T7,Third,Offline,That's more generative based feature. We we don't have to worry about multiple responses.
P29,00:30:52,T7,Third,Offline,Another thing that we need to do for you to do for the Next iteration chat logs. So the moment it doesn't to save previous chats and we'll figure out whether we should put the chat logs on the database or just in latex files or something.
P31,00:31:06,T7,Third,Offline,If it's always going to be the same format as well. That's easier to make a standard than not knowing what if the files are going to change from the US and.
P29,00:31:18,T7,Third,Offline,Also because the chat logs we have to figure out a way of identifying each individual user. So we know what trouble they can be associated with control no idea. So every every user that logs on is going to have their own chat log.
P32,00:31:30,T7,Third,Offline,One such person was stopped like foods that have and stuff what we'll have a chat log or.
P29,00:31:37,T7,Third,Offline,Ideally it will stay because if they have questions that they had before they come back and the bot will be able to have the chat log available.
P32,00:31:43,T7,Third,Offline,So do mean  like IP address?
P29,00:31:45,T7,Third,Offline,Ip address might be but I don't know like.
P32,00:31:50,T7,Third,Offline,"I don't think I'll be good to do. I feel like people don't feel comfortable with I get her some things like if I Giggles gives you the recommendation. It's like oh, yeah, not like that was my don't know when you found out kind of thing. Or if I go, I'm just at home and I want to get away from my spells. What courses are there on this and she goes with like why you  giggling courses on. I don't really seem to work."
P29,00:32:24,T7,Third,Offline,I don't know like what do you guys think? Would it worth the chat log? Should we just like having you try to be something use refreshes the page?
P31,00:32:40,T7,Third,Offline,"Refreshing. I think instead of solving it. That way. We should just have like a refresh when like, you know that thing where it's like, oh, you're about to leave a page based on how session going on. Are you sure you want to leave the page ? Rather Like saving."
P29,00:32:53,T7,Third,Offline,"Okay. Okay. Wait, It should say that if somebody refresh the page. In that case, you will still need to check what the users they are because it might seem like a new mood new like you're somebody."
P31,00:33:05,T7,Third,Offline,We can you use just session ID. Like this could be like tokens that come with.
P29,00:33:12,T7,Third,Offline,Are they?
P31,00:33:14,T7,Third,Offline,I think we shouldn't worry about this right now. I think this is like achievable.
P33,00:33:17,T7,Third,Offline,This is should be like a second deterioration in the middle of the second iteration.
P31,00:33:22,T7,Third,Offline,"I don't think she might be thinking about it like that, but I don't think she's worried about this one should do it like sequentially, but now we should worry about the deployment and getting multiple sessions."
P33,00:33:34,T7,Third,Offline,Okay? Okay for the next iteration because just in case for the meeting So what we're going to do in the next iteration.
P31,00:33:43,T7,Third,Offline,"We said I wrote down is we're gonna look into it. Well, we have to deploy the thing on python anywhere."
P33,00:34:00,T7,Third,Offline,"Okay, that's."
P31,00:34:01,T7,Third,Offline,We have to look into having multiple sessions for the chat bot. Nothing right. Now. Only one like green currently. We have to look into making the database like more modular because right now it's kind of hard coding and look into making the data more uniform like just in terms of and then we have we actually have to start looking into the queries how they're going to interact with the database and that's like passing.
P33,00:34:27,T7,Third,Offline,"I can't take this but don't worry, but."
P32,00:34:32,T7,Third,Offline,And we have to worry about testing our code.
P33,00:34:36,T7,Third,Offline,True this is this is why I'm stuck here testing. The testing code is more about Marks here. Trust me. Because if you if we just let this is a part of the free software process.
P32,00:34:53,T7,Third,Offline,That's more how we do it. Not what we do.
P31,00:34:56,T7,Third,Offline,"Yeah. Yeah, it's defiantly how we do it."
P32,00:35:01,T7,Third,Offline,Like are we organised are we deceptive? Stuff like that.
P33,00:35:04,T7,Third,Offline,So if you just keep everything and then you put in the end the test thing then you're not recognised.
P32,00:35:12,T7,Third,Offline,No.
P33,00:35:14,T7,Third,Offline,"Sure? However, for the next iteration I would say we need also to look for the state machine thing makes it clever and also maybe we include patterns in the end this next iteration. I don't think patterns will be probably easy to do."
P29,00:35:40,T7,Third,Offline,Could you send me the links to all the Articles where you got this info from sort of and also the code so I can start like maybe see if the chat bot connect it's good?
P33,00:35:49,T7,Third,Offline,"No worries once I go home, I'll do everything."
P29,00:35:53,T7,Third,Offline,Great. Thank you man.
P33,00:35:54,T7,Third,Offline,"Okay guys,."
P32,00:35:55,T7,Third,Offline,That's basically for these two minutes Muhammad.
P32,00:36:00,T7,Third,Offline,"I'm sorry really, but I really was awake for the whole night."
P29,00:36:03,T7,Third,Offline,It's OK man.
P31,00:36:22,T7,Third,Offline,I'm going to go home to eat up go to that. Apparently the library is packed. So I'm not I don't know.
P29,00:36:29,T7,Third,Offline,I don't know why you bother there.
P31,00:36:29,T7,Third,Offline,"I because I can't work better. Well,."
P33,00:36:32,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah true
P31,00:36:32,T7,Third,Offline,I don't know. It's just such like something associated not working. It's like I can not in my room anymore because it's not environment I considered as a workplace.
P33,00:36:53,T7,Third,Offline,I can't work on the lab because it's like a lot of people there.
P31,00:36:57,T7,Third,Offline,Then go to the library then.
P29,00:37:10,T7,Third,Offline,I mean if it's too it was too noisy in the third year that the first year laps or so. Yeah. I'm going to sleep.
P31,00:37:15,T7,Third,Offline,I'll be back like an hour or an hour and half.
P33,00:37:16,T7,Third,Offline,I'll send you guys links and everything
P29,00:37:24,T7,Third,Offline,"Yes, as soon as you get home, please."
P29,00:37:33,T7,Third,Offline,Language processing and signatures. I don't know what like I still have a lot about.
P32,00:37:33,T7,Third,Offline,Well I wasn't sure before we returned responses. Did we just want to return the key words? Like much of this course costs? The bot just then returns the costs.
P29,00:37:42,T7,Third,Offline,We should also think about how the Prototype looks.
P32,00:37:48,T7,Third,Offline,I think we could design also.
P29,00:38:16,T7,Third,Offline,"What I mean was like how to produce a books for each iteration. So it looks like we're actually making progress and we did we do a lot of like, you know behind the scenes stuff up and it might not."
P32,00:38:21,T7,Third,Offline,But I think it means we shouldn't designs first before we go down a path.
P31,00:38:28,T7,Third,Offline,I think they were quite flexible with what we were going to make it look like.
P32,00:38:38,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P31,00:38:46,T7,Third,Offline,He just wants to she wants to like you change the design every iteration so that we actually even if it's just back in stuff that we've done is still looks like we've done today because usually customers if they don't see like visual change. They won't believe done.
P29,00:38:50,T7,Third,Offline,That's what I'm saying.
P31,00:38:53,T7,Third,Offline,So are you good at front end stuff?
P32,00:39:10,T7,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P29,00:39:11,T7,Third,Offline,"I don't know of it so far, but the CSS is like fairly straightforward. You just copy paste."
P32,00:39:17,T7,Third,Offline,I'll talk to you two in the lab about this next iteration.
P1,00:00:07,T1,Third,Offline,"So, we don't have a question sheet this time so I don't know what we are spoused to do."
P2,00:00:12,T1,Third,Offline,"First thing, let's talk about clients."
P4,00:00:12,T1,Third,Offline,Yeah
P2,00:00:47,T1,Third,Offline,This time was better than last time but this is the other thing I heard about worse clients so far the people have had so I think our clients our did quite good especially since they had experience.
P4,00:00:59,T1,Third,Offline,Yeah
P5,00:00:59,T1,Third,Offline,But we're going to talk about issues.
P4,00:01:05,T1,Third,Offline,Nothing.
P4,00:01:08,T1,Third,Offline,"Yeah, I mean they really seem to have a plan like going forward like they know what they're going to give us next time, but I think they should just give it to us."
P2,00:01:42,T1,Third,Offline,"Our team roles haven't changed, have they?"
P4,00:01:50,T1,Third,Offline,I think since last time because we kind of.
P2,00:01:53,T1,Third,Offline,Officially.
P4,00:01:54,T1,Third,Offline,"Yeah, yeah."
P2,00:01:58,T1,Third,Offline,What are thinking about our team project? Do we have any plan for it? Not known plan right now then.
P4,00:02:13,T1,Third,Offline,No. It still not like a lot of work say be sort of I can imagine sort of like getting as the last situation. I'm just sort of dropping a bombshell was like oh yeah we also want this.
P2,00:02:34,T1,Third,Offline,We Just feel like.
P4,00:02:39,T1,Third,Offline,There's something hidden.
P2,00:02:40,T1,Third,Offline,"Yeah, their clients is something like defensive like it was very obvious in those in meetings. What I was saying again? yeah plan we have to make for our work is to see who's doing what I can do the wireframes actually get ever get all the details like an event and we sort it out from there depending on if they reply saying  that's exactly we want that you can go into planning based on her and they were trying to learn anything like the language and anything like that it says glad."
P4,00:03:23,T1,Third,Offline,I don't know.
P2,00:03:25,T1,Third,Offline,Okay. That will be trying and it dose not work so. I've tired that.
P3,00:03:35,T1,Third,Offline,What details do you need for the wireframes?
P2,00:03:37,T1,Third,Offline,We can have the one like goes up
P3,00:03:39,T1,Third,Offline,"Yeah, I put them on the wiki, I think  or on the task or something I put it somewhere."
P2,00:03:45,T1,Third,Offline,"We usually get an email about that, but we didn't get any this time. I'll try to make the wireframe"
P3,00:04:05,T1,Third,Offline,Because maybe I will wait until you have that done and I will just email her
P2,00:04:05,T1,Third,Offline,My plans are getting them tomorrow from that what else they asked us to do.
P5,00:04:13,T1,Third,Offline,I did not like what you said.
P2,00:04:15,T1,Third,Offline,All right. Yeah. Why don't?
P5,00:04:16,T1,Third,Offline,I don't like what you really have to just feel most of previous team.
P1,00:04:21,T1,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P5,00:04:21,T1,Third,Offline,I would love to do something from scratch.
P2,00:04:23,T1,Third,Offline,Yeah. I'm okay with that - just because it's less work.
P1,00:04:29,T1,Third,Offline,We all have to do this right? that later on in our careers
P4,00:04:35,T1,Third,Offline,But it's also I think when this is going to get difficult so good for our dissertation on like just maintaining as opposed to building.
P2,00:04:46,T1,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P4,00:04:47,T1,Third,Offline,Could be a bit more difficult.
P1,00:04:49,T1,Third,Offline,Or we can use other teams dissertation to build on.
P2,00:04:51,T1,Third,Offline,So we can just talk about maintaining.
P4,00:05:09,T1,Third,Offline,"It tells us what's up with those details. I don't think it would be a good idea to build the forms in word press because then the it's already got a Content management system so we could build it to like for them to editor because you know, they have like lots of things that they wanted to act to perform and."
P1,00:05:29,T1,Third,Offline,Like the sliding and all that.
P4,00:05:29,T1,Third,Offline,"Yeah, and things like that like write it down to a bunch of random variables that we might or might not use in the future. It just built in WordPress. You can just let them because it's just a my SQL database. So WordPress couldn't interact with the say I think that's that's just seems like a solid idea of that going forward."
P2,00:05:51,T1,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P2,00:05:51,T1,Third,Offline,WordPress is PHP?
P4,00:05:52,T1,Third,Offline,Yes.
P1,00:05:53,T1,Third,Offline,"Well, I have to learn that"
P4,00:05:53,T1,Third,Offline,That would be the easiest one to learn.
P2,00:06:06,T1,Third,Offline,I like that this last work.
P1,00:06:07,T1,Third,Offline,"It's one of those like You know when you're watching a really good movie, but you should be studying."
P2,00:06:14,T1,Third,Offline,"Yeah,."
P1,00:06:15,T1,Third,Offline,"You feel a bit shaky. Yeah, it feels like like I'm enjoying no work almost like shit is no work."
P2,00:06:22,T1,Third,Offline,"Yeah,I know you guys have a plan. I think they give us full full what we kind of have to do and most like as a was what they want. So I think maybe think of before I'm digging through just like estimating."
P4,00:06:45,T1,Third,Offline,"The mass email is at least something that we'd be doing from scratch and potentially a bit of work because if we want to try and make it work with HTML emails as well so we can make them look pretty because if it's standard texting also disgusting whereas HTML emails are a pain in the ass to get responsive and work on all email clients. So it's a bit like making things work with like the old versions of Internet Explorer and it sucks. You got people that specialize in this and then working on spam spam filters if they're emailing like hundreds of people at the same time and spam filters will try this trick will dull mark them as spam and so like things like MailChimp, they'll send the line batches we could be fun. Which something to write a lot about."
P2,00:07:49,T1,Third,Offline,"Yes, It depends on what their annotations are like what kind of information they know or may not know like in mass emailing there is kind of iffy about that."
P4,00:08:00,T1,Third,Offline,This seems to be fine as long as we are ding this in our own system is fine.
P1,00:08:05,T1,Third,Offline,"So as long as it's really important, I didn't want mass emails for something that's like bullshit."
P2,00:08:11,T1,Third,Offline,"Yeah,."
P5,00:08:11,T1,Third,Offline,That was one of the restrictions.
P2,00:08:14,T1,Third,Offline,"Yeah, so have to get all list of username."
P4,00:08:16,T1,Third,Offline,We might need like one of those manager preferences Pages for people to like opt-out things as soon as I get an email.
P2,00:08:32,T1,Third,Offline,That's probably a lot
P4,00:08:35,T1,Third,Offline,It just we need like another table in the database with just a list of ones and zeros.
P2,00:08:41,T1,Third,Offline,That something into more detail databased things.
P4,00:08:46,T1,Third,Offline,It teach you about that in CS1Q.
P2,00:08:48,T1,Third,Offline,I'm doing something a bit on the databases next semester. So I hope that helps
P4,00:09:20,T1,Third,Offline,I keep forgetting like you don't need to like very second seamster and for us like spend ages to plan it all out and still have thing need to do
P3,00:09:30,T1,Third,Offline,How about the presentations?
P2,00:09:40,T1,Third,Offline,"Presentations of pretty powerful. I think there's a good idea we can do 10 minutes before is so worth it. We can keep form out and that will give us some stuff to talk about in dissertation. See how we kind presented in the lab how we got that presented in the stages and things like that probably next thing and because this time I would just all over the place of schools, but other than we are good."
P4,00:10:13,T1,Third,Offline,"It Starts with the client meetings so awkward. I just waiting around like don't follow we can talk about it cause I'm Gonna Stand still quite in the meeting, but we can start the meeting because 10 smaller."
P1,00:10:22,T1,Third,Offline,"Yeah, it's awkward. I don't like having to wait on someone just like also they have the mark it."
P4,00:10:28,T1,Third,Offline,"Yes true,."
P1,00:10:29,T1,Third,Offline,But they weren't overtime last time and then we had to wait a lot. So I don't know how that happened. And I think we should have questioned that more because.
P5,00:10:38,T1,Third,Offline,I think luckily because one of these are do with training people to mark little faster next time.
P2,00:10:44,T1,Third,Offline,"Yeah. I think overall I'm pretty happy news for you in terms of like I'm doing something from scratch. So you have to develop an understanding of things. I mean, like languages we don't know yet and don't even know if you leave it here so that yeah and rather than that, I think is pretty good as project. I think it's I think it's a solid project now like know in the end. There's just a little bit to do but there's things and I think we can give them."
P3,00:11:24,T1,Third,Offline,Also we have to space everything out to make sure we have stuff to work one for the week.
P2,00:11:28,T1,Third,Offline,"Can we have a full idea or we have to make our plan again? because we didn't know about the forms being read in depth before, but after that I feel I feel like we can plan like he's doing more in the wireframes and send them just estimate online like we just use Messengers or something."
P5,00:11:50,T1,Third,Offline,If You don't know wireframe you don't need to learn PHP.
P2,00:11:52,T1,Third,Offline,"Oh, that's fine. So far, it's going well. I can't imagine us lagging behind on the project and maybe I like essence for the group a bit behind on it"
P1,00:12:17,T1,Third,Offline,Probably dissertation.
P2,00:12:17,T1,Third,Offline,Yeah but that said I don't think I don't think we're gonna fall back behind them.
P4,00:12:24,T1,Third,Offline,"In this world, I think we might have to start saying no to them because I recommend you trying to get us new stuff right up until the end."
P2,00:12:32,T1,Third,Offline,"Yeah, the next iteration of the trying to get was new stuff. Once you know,."
P4,00:12:36,T1,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P2,00:12:36,T1,Third,Offline,"This a migrant honestly, there's nothing to do because I think I think part of like as if their hopes on final project is that we're acting has a proper company group was dealing with the client to say no to things straight with you can't do as a huge part of the project because there's other team was cunt to do over working on that project and and stuff like that then if do have a bit difficulty of that. We can talk to Tim to tell him a little bit. See what he thinks like we don't think this is realistic expectation. This was a governess who thought we would change, or something like that, but I don't think this is dissertation or what we can refine etc, etc."
P3,00:13:21,T1,Third,Offline,They're pretty understanding though that saying no because every time they're like is this that feasible? I don't know you tell us.
P2,00:13:29,T1,Third,Offline,"Yeah, But I imagine if he said no to right because you don't have something to say."
P3,00:13:33,T1,Third,Offline,"Well, not just explaining it explaining why you're saying that."
P4,00:13:38,T1,Third,Offline,If you could just make up a bunch of words and they won't understand.
P2,00:13:40,T1,Third,Offline,"We got better in our dissertation. I think I haven't check on last month yet, and that's it. I can't think of anything else."
P1,00:14:05,T1,Third,Offline,What Was the last mark?
P2,00:14:11,T1,Third,Offline,It was four five four and then like the last one he left blank.
P3,00:14:15,T1,Third,Offline,That was if we put everting in the issues like the notes which I did after that. It should be fine
P2,00:14:28,T1,Third,Offline,"I still didn't an email about that, but other than that, that's pretty good."
P19,00:00:20,T5,Third,Offline,Where should we start I guess?
P20,00:00:51,T5,Third,Offline,User stories? The number of of admin stuff user clicking on a Jason found results for each incredible Devotion to the representation of the Jason about of the download button and he said it's not clear what is meant by simple representation of Json are essentially just like The doc: the vale of the Json.
P21,00:01:20,T5,Third,Offline,Such as the pretty print something.
P20,00:01:23,T5,Third,Offline,"Pretty much. Yeah, it shouldn't break a thousand or so Falls are at the watch folder mandatory field sidebar output page with filtering technical tasks coverage tests compiled build artifact. Stories for each iteration automatic publishing of PDF Jason therapy on uploading without refreshing the page. Process should be quick . PDF identification pattens. Scaling great an issue. Documentation,  wireframe changes for template creation and template much page to make your diagrams for models."
P22,00:02:28,T5,Third,Offline,This doesn't mention that we have to work move all the code for the OCR from the local stuff to the server.
P21,00:02:37,T5,Third,Offline,"I don't think was I think we already put the them they already some either you are possible. And I think maybe you were the one correct. I mean because we decided that before the meeting with Darrell, so that's that should already be on this reflect what we had discussed on the meeting."
P23,00:03:05,T5,Third,Offline,"Do not serve actually like it's making more portable. So you have less things to worry about when making sure runs on the ground ring system is basically. Yes, so basically it's probably good that at least for Next iteration probably till the end were mostly working on web app. Right. So we need to like get a like the career. I think that's the main thing for the iteration. Yeah, that going Aunt actually pour your stuff on there."
P22,00:03:45,T5,Third,Offline,Move on to schedule in general.
P20,00:03:58,T5,Third,Offline,"Yeah, I think it would be good if we could get these user stories up like our tasks basically after we have this meeting we can go up maybe to level 6 or 7 and just do them. Most of the our diagram it since we are here we can do that together and then we just discuss I've got I looked up and that I still have the documentation from the tango with Django project so we can use that for example as a kind of refresh how it is to be done. And yeah, I guess and we want to talk with other because we'll be able available so you can call them a messenger."
P21,00:04:44,T5,Third,Offline,"Yeah, I was thinking that like"
P19,00:04:51,T5,Third,Offline,Nestor as you can like you said where you could work on the these are models that's going to be like the bridge between the two things you Gobor can decide who wants to do the uploading of wants to do the OCR processing on the web app.
P23,00:05:08,T5,Third,Offline,And then we have like the code for the OCR process.
P19,00:05:12,T5,Third,Offline,"Yeah, just like how it's going to be done in the way but I don't know if it's very easy then you know."
P23,00:05:17,T5,Third,Offline,It's probably either going to be like look failing and annoying or it's gonna be just really easy. one of the two.
P19,00:05:24,T5,Third,Offline,"If it's very easy, then, you know, we can just assign more task if you are done is just better because it means we get more done so and then Dan take the lead on the Tempest creation and and I can do the results page in the filtering that sort of stuff and I'll do the help with the damp page as well. But I just don't want it, you know that the responsibility shared on one this thing task because then it's like always like you are steaming maybe the other person will be there for that but a template creation is hopefully maybe by the end of this week will be more or less than with everything except the template creation and then we can assign tasks within that."
P20,00:06:21,T5,Third,Offline,Make sense
P21,00:06:31,T5,Third,Offline,The issues with the client were they?
P19,00:06:35,T5,Third,Offline,"it went really well, we just have to do this like upload them the planning because the last five points are based on that. So I think probably Tim will join could this week? So we just we just makes it out and 20 points for this is 5% of 30 credits."
P20,00:06:55,T5,Third,Offline,It's pretty nice.
P21,00:07:00,T5,Third,Offline,Do we did we get 5 marks for the documentation?
P19,00:07:07,T5,Third,Offline,I think so. That's how it is set of this one of the four sections. I think would have been we got three four requirements for some reason for something.
P22,00:07:35,T5,Third,Offline,So I think overall like I know like some of us sometimes to gotten like frustrate me like I'm just like changing a lot but I think like over time it's going to change less enough.
P19,00:07:49,T5,Third,Offline,"Yeah. Yeah, I agree."
P23,00:07:56,T5,Third,Offline,Because you know in Fairma iI think Fairma like us like misunderstanding as well.
P19,00:08:11,T5,Third,Offline,"We should also shouldn't forget about it disappeared working on the features to produce this artifacts of the zip file or something because he's been saying that for a while and I kind of forget about it, but it apparently it's not that difficult like we can basically click on something and they get the zip file, but I think the real wants its kind of built the CI and then output it"
P21,00:08:41,T5,Third,Offline,"So with what we are doing it would like basically the local upright and like we just have a Python anywhere for the web app. So we'll use that we just make sure but the problem is that that doesn't like you have to like manually lay update it, right?"
P19,00:08:54,T5,Third,Offline,"Yeah at the moment. Yeah, but they're ones an artifact of the whole project like videos like Python wedge is the whole code in one. Is it fun?"
P20,00:09:04,T5,Third,Offline,"Yeah. So he won't so when he's crying himself. Well, actually like like open like HTML file actually."
P19,00:09:16,T5,Third,Offline,Probably I mean.
P20,00:09:17,T5,Third,Offline,Just like run the actually that's.
P19,00:09:21,T5,Third,Offline,"In the end how we will deploy how we have handled over the product we haven't covered that yet, but we will figured that but for now Python it's just demonstration."
P20,00:09:33,T5,Third,Offline,"Yeah, like he won't be using that like he like when he wants look at it more like himself as well. That makes sense. Just wanted like a good guide for them."
P19,00:09:52,T5,Third,Offline,Only the user code
P20,00:10:00,T5,Third,Offline,Right so what we left when we're like done with reservation?
P19,00:10:26,T5,Third,Offline,I think it's the pattern matching.
P20,00:10:29,T5,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P19,00:10:33,T5,Third,Offline,"This would be easier to discuss in front of like machines and just kind of goes through the user stories that we have and requirements, but."
P22,00:10:45,T5,Third,Offline,If you can look at the lab
P19,00:10:50,T5,Third,Offline,"But I think we left most of the better mentoring very and also like there will be some new requirements, you know, and Some polishing here and there."
P22,00:11:03,T5,Third,Offline,"Yeah, I think it's with the release of time for polishing. Because I feel like, you know, like Yakers is like student project. Like I wonder how much time like that guy you made it like had left over when was totally like polish it up make it a bit nicer."
P19,00:11:33,T5,Third,Offline,I think it's good that we sense so many like tasks for this iteration because this is the most amount of time will have basically until the end.
P20,00:11:45,T5,Third,Offline,Yeah
P19,00:11:45,T5,Third,Offline,"We have this break and then we have the beginning of the semester when there isn't so much. Also, another thing I wanted to write in Slack. I can just tell you guys now what you guys are supposed to things like anyway, but I read up on the dissertation and apparently quite I think half of the dissertation is about the marks are about experiences kind of explain. You know, what kind of  obstacles maybe you encountered and then how you overcame them? These kind of things kind of very distinct movements events in the project. So maybe that's a good idea to kind of just write it up in a few sentences are just as a list in a maybe even Central document or just for yourself. So that when we're doing it. Then we don't have to think like, oh how it works, you know how to year ago. So I'm going to just write"
P20,00:12:46,T5,Third,Offline,Chunk.
P19,00:12:48,T5,Third,Offline,For ourselves to explain later in the dissertation.
P21,00:12:52,T5,Third,Offline,So kind of like. You that could that be the kind of like a thing that when we're doing means every presentation of like issues run into that kind of.
P19,00:13:01,T5,Third,Offline,Yeah for example. It's just really like minimum efforts for now. Just really just a few sentences.
P21,00:13:17,T5,Third,Offline,"Yeah, just yeah, I don't think that's a good idea."
P22,00:14:01,T5,Third,Offline,So these are the things that aren't a monster so Implement deployment script that realization being a monster.
P19,00:14:13,T5,Third,Offline,I think would you filter it?
P22,00:14:18,T5,Third,Offline,It is actually things I really master.
P19,00:14:21,T5,Third,Offline,Iteration four  are you right now?
P22,00:14:24,T5,Third,Offline,No I'm just doing none at none so these are the things that aren't in any master. So I don't.
P19,00:14:32,T5,Third,Offline,I Think maybe.
P22,00:14:34,T5,Third,Offline,"In that the next one? yes, that's right. Yes master. Yeah one should actually should."
P19,00:14:43,T5,Third,Offline,I think that's close. This is actually close that on Wednesdays.
P21,00:14:52,T5,Third,Offline,Is it done?
P22,00:15:09,T5,Third,Offline,Support functionality between users and admins crazy group. So users are either standard or admins. As a as an admin only. Is that That will be for the next iteration?
P19,00:15:27,T5,Third,Offline,Sorry
P21,00:15:28,T5,Third,Offline,Would this be for the next iteration should they?
P21,00:15:33,T5,Third,Offline,It's already a assigned to Nestoras.
P19,00:15:42,T5,Third,Offline,Can we wait for this until we get some things done?
P21,00:15:42,T5,Third,Offline,Yeah
P19,00:15:42,T5,Third,Offline,So many stories and tasks that are not for any Master.
P21,00:15:52,T5,Third,Offline,This is the here this is all.
P19,00:15:54,T5,Third,Offline,It's wired.
P20,00:15:56,T5,Third,Offline,These are the ones that we just happen like multi-page on we're not doing that. This one's done.
P19,00:16:05,T5,Third,Offline,"Well, we are actually it's oh, yeah, that's another thing we have to talk about. Basically. We said the multi-page PDF it will be until the 23rd of January the 9th, but in the last two weeks,."
P20,00:16:20,T5,Third,Offline,"Okay,."
P19,00:16:21,T5,Third,Offline,"So, how do you want to implement that in slack in GitHub? with the priority or back with a label or is it with like a new iteration you must own that we want to set up."
P20,00:16:39,T5,Third,Offline,"I think we can probably have it in there is no sign of anyone. Maybe that's a bit messy, but that"
P19,00:16:50,T5,Third,Offline,You mean the ones that are for the winter for the last two weeks of the same those to anyone?
P20,00:16:55,T5,Third,Offline,"Yeah, just have them not assigned."
P19,00:16:57,T5,Third,Offline,"I think it I think it's requiring kind of good to prioritize them like, you know,."
P20,00:17:06,T5,Third,Offline,Will then them we can set.
P21,00:17:08,T5,Third,Offline,What we can set the ones for the ninth this high priority. I guess. I'm not sure if there's probably a low priority level and if there is a weekend created
P22,00:17:17,T5,Third,Offline,We can set those ones as high priority
P19,00:17:22,T5,Third,Offline,So the privatization is through labeling?
P21,00:17:26,T5,Third,Offline,"Yeah, we can well, I mean, I don't know."
P19,00:17:28,T5,Third,Offline,"Just because last time we had you know, we had we did everything with labels and then it was said that we should do it with milestones. So it's just them I'm not certain if it's between two official milestones do we create a new Milestone or do we just label it?"
P20,00:17:54,T5,Third,Offline,Yeah. That's a good question
P22,00:18:02,T5,Third,Offline,Without was mainly because they to do I mean this is an instance for like
P23,00:18:08,T5,Third,Offline,"Yeah, I mean it's basically like bringing back to you a little bit because we had that the issue to Mnagos that like anything that is in the Milestone used to do. But when we have is he like scenario, where are like half a milestone is done."
P22,00:18:28,T5,Third,Offline,"So yeah, man, we should create between milestone I should ask Tim."
P19,00:18:38,T5,Third,Offline,"Yeah, but this just came up on the meeting. So it wasn't like you had a lot of time. Yeah, we just realized this after discussed the outcome of the meeting."
P21,00:18:38,T5,Third,Offline,"Yeah, I know, I'm not saying that like we could have 100 present."
P19,00:18:54,T5,Third,Offline,Anyone wants to write an email to Tim?
P21,00:19:04,T5,Third,Offline,It's a good idea
P22,00:19:30,T5,Third,Offline,"But yeah, generally."
P20,00:19:35,T5,Third,Offline,This is going to be for the 23rd like
P22,00:19:38,T5,Third,Offline,"Even amongst the things are here because of up of work, I promise you were gonna make a bunch more when we get to the Next iteration, but like of the things that we thought of to do almost all of them,."
P19,00:19:51,T5,Third,Offline,"Hopefully if everything goes well, yeah so much all the tasks."
P21,00:19:57,T5,Third,Offline,Yeah. I mean it's possible.
P22,00:19:59,T5,Third,Offline,Because we have got we have got a lot more like a lot more like this one.
P19,00:20:09,T5,Third,Offline,"There will only be one more iteration after 23rd is literally one more after that. It's dissertation writing handing over that project. And anyway, that time will be the not busiest. So I think we're just finish up for the next iteration until the end of February after that dissertation time. It's worth one quarter plus preparing for the final demo, which is worth 10%. We can can explore the Neural networks for the summer If you want to. What you guys think anything else? we don't have to stay in full hour."
P22,00:21:32,T5,Third,Offline,"Yeah, I know I know. Should we don't just like say okay we done and then the back of that world is over? Because it was the best thing we could talk about this think it's just what we are what you want to do now is statement this thing which is the weakest divesting basically. So if you want to be fancy and more professional than we could do Branch testing thing with something like that."
P19,00:22:16,T5,Third,Offline,"You know, who was there were these different levels of testing? I just remember that like that highest is like this safety-critical testing when you just do like crazy much like it's really a lot of you're not gonna do that, but maybe I seem to remember that maybe you know, I said that like for the thing project it's kind of good District in the Branch Testing which is like the next level up when you. It's basically, you know, like flow if statements and know like make sure that all branches are covered but just statements,."
P20,00:23:04,T5,Third,Offline,Right. Okay. So this is just have to do with how much I like how much coverage with that? Is that what it means or like.
P19,00:23:14,T5,Third,Offline,"I think code coverage is as we know now is just basically the first the ratio of statements that are executed in the test versus all the statements but code coverage can be understood this like in terms of branch is as well. Right now we were just thinking about slave man coverage, but maybe you should be thinking about Branch coverage."
P20,00:23:41,T5,Third,Offline,Right. Okay. But so the tests themselves don't look that different.
P19,00:23:50,T5,Third,Offline,"Let's say I have to look this up as well. But basically if you had such an if statements then maybe if you just have a statement in the if section when test  that then that's fine, but there can be something and you're not testing the else part then statement wise. You're right with Branch coverage. Why is you're not testing was happening in the else part, you know, it should because It might have been as you go into the else part. Maybe the code broke."
P20,00:24:36,T5,Third,Offline,Would you then like this like the way you guys you have one test that goes through one branch another test that goes through another?
P19,00:24:48,T5,Third,Offline,"That's how it should be is one. That should just test one simple maybe look for the next iteration, I dont't know  First. We want have the features that with some testing with a good testing but"
P20,00:25:17,T5,Third,Offline,"Seem a little like I'm probably mark wise make sense, but it seems like a funny of like to do the project and then work a bunch of tests because like I said, you don't need them."
P22,00:25:34,T5,Third,Offline,If you not into development then you wont be doing tests anymore. Obviously if someone else picks it up.
P19,00:25:44,T5,Third,Offline,What do you mean?
P22,00:25:46,T5,Third,Offline,"Well, like the tests are handy for like what what are you working on right ?"
P19,00:25:53,T5,Third,Offline,"Well, if you're doing this during development and yes to show that's like the best practice but in general to test what you have written them if you write this after it's still better than no test at all."
P22,00:26:05,T5,Third,Offline,Yes.
P11,00:00:21,T3,Third,Offline,Is there something to talk about?
P10,00:00:37,T3,Third,Offline,It's the end of the semester. I fee like we have done some progress.
P11,00:00:42,T3,Third,Offline,So how are you feeling about the project?
P10,00:00:59,T3,Third,Offline,"I feel like I mean so at the beginning but I was happy and we were proceeding like well their anger I felt we were like I had my other teams then like we kind of slow down a bit because of the deadline, but now we have to you work on it and progress a little bit at least like try to implement the tracking part because it is a fundamental part of our project."
P11,00:01:31,T3,Third,Offline,True.
P11,00:01:32,T3,Third,Offline,"I get what you're saying. Like we started off really strongly I would say and we seem to be doing quite a lot for it. And then as soon as deadlines came out, I was like"
P10,00:01:48,T3,Third,Offline,"And then Yeah. But I don't know if we like since when I had liked the interview and they asked me like that you regret choosing new technologies like it was the first time that I thought about it and then just like no, then maybe. It would much simpler with django."
P11,00:02:24,T3,Third,Offline,TRUE
P10,00:02:26,T3,Third,Offline,"I mean, it's nice. It's a very good technology to know how to use and it's just."
P11,00:02:33,T3,Third,Offline,A steep learning curve.
P10,00:02:34,T3,Third,Offline,"Yeah, it is."
P11,00:02:34,T3,Third,Offline,"But even if we did use Django though, I mean would it would have been easier to do?"
P10,00:02:43,T3,Third,Offline,"At least the entire setup of the like, I mean in the first two days you could have done the entire setup of the up and just tracking then also we spent a lot of time on Docker."
P11,00:03:04,T3,Third,Offline,"Yeah. That and Sarah is like was working just some that and I mean, I understand the importance. But maybe it was not like a priority."
P10,00:03:17,T3,Third,Offline,Yeah. I mean if you put some of that effort in like some other part of the project maybe It would have progressed a little bit more but and I think I think she does really care about that or she really likes that and I'm like their fault.
P11,00:03:48,T3,Third,Offline,Cuz you weren't sure just because I was the last person to. I think you have. I hope the meeting today goes well.
P10,00:04:27,T3,Third,Offline,We have to kind of prepare and to try to learn. Do we have to prepare like slides or something?
P11,00:04:33,T3,Third,Offline,I think so.
P10,00:04:33,T3,Third,Offline,Is it okay if we like go to Starbucks and do some while we get coffee?
P11,00:04:38,T3,Third,Offline,Yes
P10,00:04:39,T3,Third,Offline,I really need coffee or we can grab it and go to the lab. I don't care I just need coffee. I wanted to get it before coming here. Then like put the retrospective no so here but I also remember the last time Time to told us to do kind of retrospective before. He wanted us to do this for some time before. I don't know before doing the retrospective just like requirements gathering for the next spring.
P11,00:05:21,T3,Third,Offline,For the next thing
P10,00:05:21,T3,Third,Offline,"Yeah. I mean, the only thing he took was basically is just a specific enough, right?"
P11,00:05:26,T3,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P10,00:05:28,T3,Third,Offline,So if we make more specific points.
P11,00:05:31,T3,Third,Offline,I think we kind of know what to do for this round.
P10,00:05:34,T3,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P11,00:05:36,T3,Third,Offline,But I feel I got you mean about the project itself kind of those you like doing very slowly for the last two weeks or so.
P10,00:05:44,T3,Third,Offline,Yeah. The thing is I feel like you're kind of a critical point that either we like start working on it and then we kind of get like pushed into second semester? and we have like Equity with like or we just slow it down and nobody does anything for entire break.
P11,00:06:07,T3,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P10,00:06:08,T3,Third,Offline,We will be in a bad position.
P11,00:06:11,T3,Third,Offline,No for sure.
P11,00:06:19,T3,Third,Offline,It's going to be hard to keep everyone working through from the ones I can same myself we're gonna actually have to do is daily stand-ups and all of that shit.
P10,00:06:30,T3,Third,Offline,Yeah. A  Skype meeting call.
P11,00:06:34,T3,Third,Offline,"Yeah. Well, let's keep this aside and see this like as a quick refresh for what we you're doing. What were the last thing we did?"
P10,00:07:07,T3,Third,Offline,Last thing we emailed Tim.
P11,00:07:22,T3,Third,Offline,In each 10 minutes you're in void or it's like 30 seconds away. She did not think that I reply to her? Sorry
P10,00:07:38,T3,Third,Offline,"I know, I understand"
P11,00:07:58,T3,Third,Offline,"Oops. so, we did actually email him with more things?"
P10,00:08:16,T3,Third,Offline,I think we have to talk for the entire half an hour.
P11,00:08:21,T3,Third,Offline,For this?
P10,00:08:22,T3,Third,Offline,No for like the meeting.
P11,00:08:24,T3,Third,Offline,We need go over the information.
P10,00:08:28,T3,Third,Offline,"Because like last time we were just like okay, that's it."
P11,00:08:30,T3,Third,Offline,What was the talk about? I think Mac can through his report in detail.
P10,00:08:54,T3,Third,Offline,So if he talks about like that for like five minutes so five minutes will be kind of we introduce what we have done
P11,00:09:08,T3,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P10,00:09:08,T3,Third,Offline,"Briefly five-minute he talks five minutes Sara talks, and that's 15 minutes."
P11,00:09:14,T3,Third,Offline,Very good.
P10,00:09:23,T3,Third,Offline,I can kind of introduce the fact that we will put the dashboard into the so the report into dashboard. Like he did every page is a thing that I've modified and and I'll just say he like once we have implemented and we can like do this and that and this and that and I will show that now we have more than one visualization and everything else and then you can talk about Detroit's visualization. It's just he said he's just.
P13,00:10:17,T3,Third,Offline,I thought it's in 11 and I don't know why. Okay what's the deal?
P10,00:10:17,T3,Third,Offline,"Just a normal meeting actually about the progress of the project. We are saying if you like the project is going well, but that it has slowed down a bit in the last like last like Sprint and that we need to kind of push a little bit now because otherwise it's going."
P13,00:10:57,T3,Third,Offline,We can't let the trend to continue. Yes.
P10,00:11:00,T3,Third,Offline,Yeah. That's what I was saying
P13,00:11:01,T3,Third,Offline,I agree.
P10,00:11:03,T3,Third,Offline,Because If we let the trend continued over Christmas break. Then we're done.
P11,00:11:07,T3,Third,Offline,I was gonna say it's gonna be pretty tough to keep everyone working together over Christmas. So it's going to be actually every I think like and I'm guilty of this as well. But we need to actually respond to the stand-up bot.
P13,00:11:21,T3,Third,Offline,I was thinking about removing it.
P11,00:11:23,T3,Third,Offline,Yeah?
P13,00:11:23,T3,Third,Offline,"Yeah, because because of the responses but it's fine if you want to keep it."
P11,00:11:29,T3,Third,Offline,Well..
P13,00:11:29,T3,Third,Offline,Yes.
P11,00:11:30,T3,Third,Offline,"I don't have every day is like effective to be honest, but."
P13,00:11:34,T3,Third,Offline,Probably not now.
P11,00:11:35,T3,Third,Offline,But it should be more than once a week?
P13,00:11:38,T3,Third,Offline,It's not technically not it's a web hook running through.
P11,00:11:42,T3,Third,Offline,"Oh, really?"
P13,00:11:43,T3,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P11,00:11:44,T3,Third,Offline,That's cool.
P13,00:11:44,T3,Third,Offline,"It's Just it just sends a post request like every day so I can probably like show you something else to go. But yes, I agree for winds up of doing our work. We're doing I feel like Yeah. That's basically it"
P10,00:12:15,T3,Third,Offline,Everything else like it's kind of Okay. It's just like maybe. Like the other group working on the project is using django and I don't know if they have like maybe progress a little bit more just because they already know.
P13,00:12:28,T3,Third,Offline,"They are having very serious problems with django, especially running into limitations of django template system."
P11,00:12:35,T3,Third,Offline,Really?
P13,00:12:35,T3,Third,Offline,"I was talking to John the other day and yesterday, I don't know. Oh, no, you won't have that was Tim and I, but yesterday they were having a pretty serious brainstorming session. I overheard a lot of it and they are running into problems. They are running into problems that are technologically when was it by django. I think."
P10,00:12:58,T3,Third,Offline,"No angular. It's very good for The template part you you know, when I yesterday I showed you like when you that I usually that there was at component"
P11,00:13:09,T3,Third,Offline,Yeah
P10,00:13:09,T3,Third,Offline,And there is metadata. There you use a selector and then with a selector in like in the template you just write tag writing the name of this app and name of the selector and you just have that employee inside another thumping wherever you want. It just kind of like is like just cutting a piece of lightning thing and pacing and everyone.
P13,00:13:31,T3,Third,Offline,"I feel like another thing the so maybe that kind of went over your head there. I should explain it but further, but when I say Dom manipulation JavaScript works with the actual Dome of the page the hierarchical XML structure that is made up of."
P11,00:13:48,T3,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P13,00:13:49,T3,Third,Offline,Python does not it does not have the same tools the JavaScript eyes and it can it's very much a static. We driven web framework. We can the expect page refreshes and different pages for everything. And what was the other group lamenting was that they are now going to have to write a shit ton of jQuery ajax to get around the the restrictions of the Python puts put some place Whereas.
P11,00:14:21,T3,Third,Offline,I thought he wanted wanted to use flask
P13,00:14:23,T3,Third,Offline,He didn't the rest of his team thought would be easier. They are using flask as well. But yeah.
P13,00:14:34,T3,Third,Offline,"It may I think that the trade-off is it might be age initial development? But however, you end up picking up more Technologies towards the ends where I was we avoided overs too top-heavy. Whereas we're picking up with the Technologies now and then that will become easier on the way."
P10,00:14:53,T3,Third,Offline,I kind of understand it but I don't master it.
P13,00:15:02,T3,Third,Offline,I also think that I need to up my productivity and regards to the Project's the model the models themselves. They need to be implemented next iteration and that needs to be done if we were to stay on track so that will definitely require more work to do.
P11,00:15:23,T3,Third,Offline,"Yeah, I didn't mean to do it like a long sit down and everything for the cases of today. What kind of shit, sorry what kind of stuff do you want to mention?"
P10,00:15:38,T3,Third,Offline,"Okay, so that so in the next print. We say that we will."
P11,00:15:50,T3,Third,Offline,Do you want to have this implemented?
P10,00:15:54,T3,Third,Offline,Well first thing first is implementing user tracking methods.
P11,00:16:00,T3,Third,Offline,True.
P11,00:16:00,T3,Third,Offline,That's.
P13,00:16:01,T3,Third,Offline,I think our database implemented would be good. If we're putting that on the presentation. Yes.
P10,00:16:08,T3,Third,Offline,Waite
P13,00:16:08,T3,Third,Offline,Yes.
P10,00:16:10,T3,Third,Offline,Not implementing user tracking methods just track Mouse clicks on make some.
P11,00:16:16,T3,Third,Offline,Nice.
P10,00:16:16,T3,Third,Offline,Because we need to answer it. Like.
P11,00:16:20,T3,Third,Offline,It has to be some work that Tim can look at the next meeting.
P13,00:16:24,T3,Third,Offline,"Okay. Then, next we'll be implementing a database for one user to keep track of work to save the state of the user tracking."
P10,00:16:36,T3,Third,Offline,"Okay, since we have to like talk for half an hour, we were thinking that maybe you can talk about like our choice of database for the next print and like saying why we are kind of you know, like five minutes just to kind."
P11,00:16:51,T3,Third,Offline,Or at least explain the debate between the databases.
P13,00:16:54,T3,Third,Offline,Yes
P10,00:16:54,T3,Third,Offline,Then Matthew can explain about.
P13,00:16:57,T3,Third,Offline,"Do you think, just to talk with that. You think that that what we want what Tim wants to see them because I remember Danny specifically saying that they don't really care about the implementation details as much and I feel like a discussion on the implementation details of the database may go against what Tim is wanting to hear I would love to talk about databases with Tim at length, but I don't know if that's what he wants to hear."
P11,00:17:29,T3,Third,Offline,Well if he wants to talk about like PSD stuff then what can you mention you can talk about.
P13,00:17:37,T3,Third,Offline,More about functionality because like Tim is there to observe our meeting with a customer and like in the case of an argument we could also talk about implementation because he knows but if it was general customer.
P11,00:17:51,T3,Third,Offline,This is for Tim
P10,00:17:51,T3,Third,Offline,"Yeah. Yeah, but I think he's like you cannot really talk about PSD thing because it is just too much theory."
P13,00:18:02,T3,Third,Offline,Has Mat written his report as well?
P11,00:18:24,T3,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P10,00:18:25,T3,Third,Offline,"Yeah, it's a good one."
P11,00:18:25,T3,Third,Offline,So we need new term goals very clearly and precisely elaborated longer-term goals being think.
P10,00:18:41,T3,Third,Offline,I told you it was a fluent.
P11,00:18:45,T3,Third,Offline,In that case. That's when you want something you should do like timeline.
P13,00:18:54,T3,Third,Offline,We should also explain the if we don't go into implementation details of the database which that least explain what are actually it was explained. What ideas we have for how we manage our data going forward.
P10,00:19:09,T3,Third,Offline,"Yeah. Yeah, we can talk about that"
P13,00:19:11,T3,Third,Offline,The different types of database we may be using we may be using more than one database for ask doctor could.
P10,00:19:21,T3,Third,Offline,Because we have different type of data.
P13,00:19:23,T3,Third,Offline,Because we have different types of the like if we are to avoid all of the csvs and that will be more easy to handle and non-relational database than it would be in a relational one as it's already don't knowing and that's that's where non-relational. chains whereas frequent queries such as the user ID the login details perhaps even the tracking may benefit from a relational database and these are things that I feel like we can bring up and talk about it.
P10,00:19:57,T3,Third,Offline,"Because like for the user tracking, I think you need to query it every time the user logs in and then you have to change like the the database every time that the user clicks on something weird like that."
P13,00:20:12,T3,Third,Offline,"You have to write to the database. Yeah, which which would benefit from an acid wake post like postgresql or just MySQL or my RDB or something like that that would definitely benefit from something like that."
P10,00:20:30,T3,Third,Offline,And then well we can show I have you seen like the dashboard that I sent on.
P13,00:20:40,T3,Third,Offline,I have not.
P10,00:20:40,T3,Third,Offline,I sent it on messenger.
P13,00:20:42,T3,Third,Offline,"Oh, you sent on messenger."
P10,00:20:43,T3,Third,Offline,Just sent the screen of how I modified.
P13,00:20:48,T3,Third,Offline,I see.
P10,00:20:48,T3,Third,Offline,So we can just say like our plan was to like track the most clicked report and then show the most click report in the first page like that.
P13,00:21:02,T3,Third,Offline,Excellent I link this.
P10,00:21:03,T3,Third,Offline,We can already see it and then the the like the for box boxes on the top they are just to kind of show the tracking things we are doing for us at the moment. Just that we can see it.
P13,00:21:26,T3,Third,Offline,You mentioned about the modification to bootstrap.
P10,00:21:29,T3,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P13,00:21:31,T3,Third,Offline,Do you think that it's doable?
P10,00:21:34,T3,Third,Offline,So yesterday I created a branch and I try to update its bootstrap three to bootstrap four. I wanted to shoot myself because it was just like I think I kind of the only problem is there's math part because everything else since like since I've done everything else. I know the kind of backward compatibility. So I kept everything in between the two and so for bootstrap four I just had to modify like two words on like whatever I have done in like not work that was made by the template just doesn't work and I'm trying to like fix it but I'll see how much time it takes but bootstrap four is is better than the bootstrap three. So at least life of responsiveness because they have like they have these cards which are just basically like just squares and they have properties so that you can group these squares into decks or into columns and they automatically resize and like.
P13,00:22:48,T3,Third,Offline,Product things.
P10,00:22:48,T3,Third,Offline,That means I don't have to do it.
P13,00:22:51,T3,Third,Offline,Bootstrap is just so much better. So yeah.
P10,00:23:06,T3,Third,Offline,"For the tracking I think we maybe maybe we can talk about like how in the next print we want to track the clicks, but that's like, you know over the time. We will also track maybe time spent on a page and Other user behavior and then we can see that by January or February. We will have the user login as well. And I don't know if like it depends how we decide to proceed about like the optimization like the same we were talking about yesterday."
P13,00:23:49,T3,Third,Offline,"Yeah, I feel like user login should should be quite easy to implement after we have database structures in place."
P10,00:24:04,T3,Third,Offline,I need to look into like angular user authentication thing because I do you remember that django had its own like.
P13,00:24:13,T3,Third,Offline,An admin page the idea admin page and that sort of stuff was sugar sugar on top of the framework that used.
P13,00:24:25,T3,Third,Offline,"You would probably have to write your own management page to get something like that. However, there is probably similar things that other people have done."
P10,00:24:36,T3,Third,Offline,"Yeah, exactly. That's what we need to probably to research but like the future we yeah, probably we need like a almost working prototype for just one user and think about"
P13,00:24:54,T3,Third,Offline,"I feel like we're getting close to that because we have. We are all working on these desperate Technologies, but I feel like they're all coming together towards it like researching D3 looking into organizing pair the remote clicks tracking user stuff and databases. Like those are the things that we need to mix together to make the app ultimately and yeah, I think that."
P10,00:25:32,T3,Third,Offline,"Yeah the only the like the only thing I'm not very sure of is that we need to generate the dashboard. So the main page dynamically because we need to change it based on the user tracking right, but I'm just like how do we know how many reports we want you to first page and if we have them how do we resize them? Because I that's that's kind of the problem because I if you have like five reports and you put them all like one next to the other there will be very small in Oracle. So you need to kind of put them into maybe one for us or like to First than one and then other two."
P13,00:26:20,T3,Third,Offline,Quick way I thank that that's another set of requirements that we're going to be together from Adam.
P10,00:26:25,T3,Third,Offline,So we could just put like one or maybe two or like a fixed size and then.
P13,00:26:36,T3,Third,Offline,Because now we're drunk that into specifics of what what him he wants. He wants to see I think you'll get back to us and say that ultimately is our own design decision.
P13,00:26:48,T3,Third,Offline,"I have a feeling how'll be the case. But I feel like yeah, no, that's those are good questions and they do anything else in order to get like a proper set of requirements. I mean so far has been really good. We've gotten some good General and concrete requirements for what we're doing. But yeah."
P10,00:27:19,T3,Third,Offline,The only thing so like I don't when when I went like to creamer they were like talking about how they use like. They basically I think they use mostly like statistics to understand one like the user is doing something wrong or like and they suggest like you may you may need to do this because you didn't do it and but.
P13,00:27:46,T3,Third,Offline,Statical analysis for the data.
P10,00:27:48,T3,Third,Offline,For that we kind of need to also understand the data and to see like you're doing this but it's wrong because I you need to do something else if you want to add the cost of something something right? So I think that's why Adam and the beginning was saying that using Medical Data would be difficult because he wants us to work with that data as well. It is basically just the user interaction with this specific kind of data.
P13,00:28:18,T3,Third,Offline,I feel like in using a non-relational database to store the medical data now that implicitly doesn't Define the headers of the table right there. Those are defined by what it parses the way it's towards that end Jason and there's.
P11,00:28:43,T3,Third,Offline,They have the first line is heading so.
P13,00:28:45,T3,Third,Offline,"Well, yes, that's him. I'm warming that's how we as humans can eventually understand that arrangement. But to the database the database doesn't have a management system that stores those things and it doesn't need to be up like migrated to say deal with a new set of data. We could very easily import an entire new set of data and then have our front end work of that with very little modification. All that would need to be changed is the the the API hook between .net core and angular. You wouldn't have to do anything about that that would all be in the model. So that just gets you change a few lines of code and You're Off to the races. Basically that's that's the general idea. Anyway, that will that will become more apparent as implementation actually happens specifically in the next iteration and I'll be working quite closely with you and discussing how that works. And you guys as well just to show how that's working. What are your thoughts like so."
P11,00:29:58,T3,Third,Offline,I'm still thinking about the presentation for today.
P13,00:30:01,T3,Third,Offline,Okay. So are you very pretty nervous and I was like wait a minute.
P11,00:30:09,T3,Third,Offline,Also the charge and stuff like that. I just can't get anything to work so I might I might.
P10,00:30:20,T3,Third,Offline,We can hard code it.
P11,00:30:22,T3,Third,Offline,"Yeah, I think we can figure out stuff. Sorry, so if we covered most of the projects stuff we're good?"
P13,00:30:45,T3,Third,Offline,Yes.
P11,00:30:46,T3,Third,Offline,Sweet.
P13,00:30:47,T3,Third,Offline,Waite! No we are done.
P11,00:30:48,T3,Third,Offline,"If you hold this for something else, I don't mind"
P13,00:30:49,T3,Third,Offline,"No, I was looking if there was one last time pops into my head."
P6,00:00:25,T2,Third,Offline,I was here idea I went to. What his name Michel to sort out some issues with our gitlab and virtual machine.
P7,00:00:43,T2,Third,Offline,What are the issues?
P6,00:00:45,T2,Third,Offline,I can't get Android to run one on it.
P7,00:00:51,T2,Third,Offline,Oh right.
P6,00:00:51,T2,Third,Offline,For continuous integration because it would need to download.
P8,00:01:03,T2,Third,Offline,Did you guys start?
P6,00:01:03,T2,Third,Offline,"Did you wake up? So anything you say now? Can and will be against you in the court of Law. Okay. So what's going on well, I suppose we should just talk to the last iteration. Right?"
P8,00:01:18,T2,Third,Offline,Yes.
P7,00:01:20,T2,Third,Offline,So you want to start Yosef?
P6,00:01:24,T2,Third,Offline,You're putting me in the spot
P7,00:01:24,T2,Third,Offline,We kind of already did this retrospective than.
P6,00:01:32,T2,Third,Offline,Yeah. I mean we have pretty achieved all the other milestone that was set. The only one that wasn't fully achieved the whitelist. It's been sorted because of in on the day of...
P8,00:01:50,T2,Third,Offline,Okay.
P6,00:01:50,T2,Third,Offline,On the day of was it called?
P8,00:01:53,T2,Third,Offline,Presentation meeting
P7,00:01:55,T2,Third,Offline,Demonstration.
P6,00:01:55,T2,Third,Offline,"The demonstration, you know from the conversation I had with with Norman, you know, I was able to find out why. So it was just to do with the the name that the device was given was too long was taking up too many space. So now the I've already sent the match take your time after the exam. You can match that one. Look is already done so without everything we set out to do is all so accomplished. On the on the team walk inside of things. I think we are working pretty well as a team and I think that - you know, it comes with a lot. Of course, I know of some teams were."
P7,00:02:52,T2,Third,Offline,Those people that just half of them a showed up.
P6,00:02:55,T2,Third,Offline,We taking ownership when when you get allocated a task.
P7,00:03:04,T2,Third,Offline,Everyone's doing the work that they're set.
P8,00:03:08,T2,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P7,00:03:08,T2,Third,Offline,"The people will say extract the only hope to them handling them fine. I feel our team works very good. But to be the only thing I think that we could change with team work more maybe know that this is maybe a video on from a point of the pike on development went very well in this iteration, we got everything sorted really quite early and as normally say that."
P8,00:03:34,T2,Third,Offline,There is no much
P7,00:03:35,T2,Third,Offline,There is no really much does not really much left to do the pipe outside. So maybe look at I would not maybe that it would be better. If look at my red up all the Christmas period on what you guys have been doing with the Android side of things and started to help because it's really the were called there is a bit more leaning towards more work on the outside.
P6,00:04:00,T2,Third,Offline,On the backhand side of things in my seems like there is not a lot to do. But have you figured out how you're going to be communicating with the.
P7,00:04:13,T2,Third,Offline,LTE data?
P6,00:04:14,T2,Third,Offline,So the Pinecone.
P7,00:04:24,T2,Third,Offline,"I just communication to enter into war. Okay, so the Pinecone and the phone communicate to each other via abilities."
P6,00:04:33,T2,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P7,00:04:33,T2,Third,Offline,The Pinecone when.
P8,00:04:35,T2,Third,Offline,To the sensor
P7,00:04:35,T2,Third,Offline,"Yeah the Pinecone which is attached to the sensor when it wakes up. It will take a reading from the sensor and if it's within or outside the given threshold if we if there is one set then it will send the data using LT communication to the Gateway network, but it's connected to"
P6,00:05:00,T2,Third,Offline,So so the Pinecone is going to connect to the Gateway.
P7,00:05:06,T2,Third,Offline,"Yeah, we all LT gateway."
P6,00:05:08,T2,Third,Offline,Have you.
P7,00:05:08,T2,Third,Offline,"Not the LT gateway, Sorry I keep saying."
P8,00:05:11,T2,Third,Offline,Laura.
P6,00:05:12,T2,Third,Offline,Laura gateway. Have you read up or do you have an idea like in terms of specific tasks?
P7,00:05:18,T2,Third,Offline,Yeah. I have broken down to specific tasks on the get Gitlab I think it can and those really help to many things that I want to do this. The one thing we do is find out the format that Laura sends and according to Norman. It's and the documentation. It's just a quick 5-10 minute read up on that. It says just to be Json packet. So all we need to do from then is figure out a generic model for sending. Add to the default layout kind of shell go belt for the main lpy which out of that to the end of that. It says whatever data you've collected f s Within These better values or so safety switch values then communicate it to via or up to the Gateway server that it has stored else it's just nothing communicator. We just have to make sure we format out to the right packet - it still a couple of tasks.
P6,00:06:26,T2,Third,Offline,"The storage of data on the Packham device itself does not have to you know, do the what kind of form of the to see how does he have like on the support SQL or?"
P7,00:06:36,T2,Third,Offline,"You can export SQL data as Json data, can you?"
P6,00:06:41,T2,Third,Offline,I don't know. That's why I'm asking.
P7,00:06:44,T2,Third,Offline,"Why would do want to, it't take a reading and then them forget it."
P6,00:06:55,T2,Third,Offline,So so the file Pie doesn't need to store.
P7,00:06:59,T2,Third,Offline,"It doesn't store any of the data recording. It just looks at it and if you set a threshold if you haven't set a threshold at the same every day of packet, if you have that threshold, then what I'll do is I'll check to see if it says zero so the special and then send it that in there forget it and go back into deep sleep."
P6,00:07:18,T2,Third,Offline,They have given up here you are they'll be save on the.
P7,00:07:21,T2,Third,Offline,Those received during the provision of the app form.
P8,00:07:25,T2,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P6,00:07:26,T2,Third,Offline,Where In the file pie. What kind of storage is it going to use like a persistent storage thing?
P7,00:07:32,T2,Third,Offline,"Yes, the the storage on the pinecone just our parents. It's just a read-only storage. I think you can always read only."
P6,00:07:43,T2,Third,Offline,If it's a little light.
P7,00:07:47,T2,Third,Offline,"It's read and write, but for the purposes of what has been put into sensor system it should be read only because It won't be writing any new data into this thing and we'll just run the cord look at the data set and the data go back to sleep and just keep doing that and all the same issue provision, like the network service connected to the Gateway service connected to the Yaki Yabi and the day store and the flash memory. Once you prevision to phone it's just pyramid and unchanging until you reboot it we reconnect the phone to it."
P6,00:08:27,T2,Third,Offline,"Yeah, do you want to say something?"
P8,00:08:31,T2,Third,Offline,"Yeah, I just wanted to say that you know, I think one of the issues that we have on the app side is just the testing and I think you know over the all these since you have their own the whole free time meeting. I think we can both read up on how to do testing with the Android app."
P6,00:08:50,T2,Third,Offline,"I've been waiting all of you know in my whatever I get bored about, you know, studying engineering, you know, just generally."
P7,00:09:00,T2,Third,Offline,So I guess you have been looking at intercommunication for that a lot then if you done everything you board of engineering so imagine how to it's a lot.
P8,00:09:09,T2,Third,Offline,"Yeah, I get for every 10 minutes of reading lectures every while I can everyone's like to read a lot."
P6,00:09:18,T2,Third,Offline,"Yeah, one of the things I plan to do over the coming holiday is. I have started to you know, what is the start writing some of the tests? But only problem I encountered is the way because of the way the course is structured just now maybe it makes it difficult to test things in isolation like the unit testing. So what I plan to do is I went back and read, you know, the claim code thing that we had in one of the PSD. So I went back and look at that and watch the video about you know, the clinical architecture, so I'm going to try and refract or do you think so we do very Less in our main activity. So we are going to have a lot of."
P7,00:10:16,T2,Third,Offline,Modules.
P6,00:10:16,T2,Third,Offline,Class modules outside.
P8,00:10:19,T2,Third,Offline,And then in the main activity will just call.
P6,00:10:21,T2,Third,Offline,"We just call the guy with not yet come with their own needs. So if it would make you know, scalable maintainable going forward because even if we stopped working on it and somebody can pick it up and just."
P7,00:10:36,T2,Third,Offline,"Start working. I was going to say that the second lab like I think of all I don't think it was just best for your iteration four we had to reprovision all of the Pinecone code to make it more modular as well. Just so we could do the testing as well, so"
P6,00:10:56,T2,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P7,00:10:56,T2,Third,Offline,I think that's the right direction to take.
P6,00:10:58,T2,Third,Offline,So that we can and and the format will be once you've been assigned a task.
P8,00:11:05,T2,Third,Offline,You have to create a new class.
P6,00:11:07,T2,Third,Offline,"You put class and see how you can link it up to the main. And then before you start even coding for that what you want to achieve right away small test, you know, and then do your code to pass that test test driven development."
P8,00:11:27,T2,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P6,00:11:27,T2,Third,Offline,I think we need to make it more.
P7,00:11:33,T2,Third,Offline,It's definitely an idea going forward.
P6,00:11:37,T2,Third,Offline,I know we've done our job development - like I just don't get something there.
P8,00:11:42,T2,Third,Offline,"I think you look for this before it is something remember that we always see how like, you know, once you have like this large pile of classes and then just like just refactor everything and turn it into an interface or some sort of that. Maybe I'm not saying that we have to go back and be like that maybe."
P6,00:12:05,T2,Third,Offline,The code is still easy to refactor because.
P8,00:12:10,T2,Third,Offline,Yes.
P6,00:12:10,T2,Third,Offline,It's not  massive or anything and what we've done refactoring it would make our life easier for writers to be so easy.
P9,00:12:20,T2,Third,Offline,Should we also put in which we put in the documentation like for people who want like do you have to put in a project like documentation on how to continue this project?
P6,00:12:33,T2,Third,Offline,"We are going to write a dissertation. I think a lot can be obtained from whatever comment since they are not easily understood, you know, you might need to write some comment, but into that, you know, very obvious."
P9,00:13:02,T2,Third,Offline,"Yeah,."
P7,00:13:03,T2,Third,Offline,It just happened to realize what level of comment to put yet.
P6,00:13:09,T2,Third,Offline,Customers comment is.
P7,00:13:11,T2,Third,Offline,Makes the code unreadable two level comments. Also just makes the code unreadable.
P6,00:13:17,T2,Third,Offline,"If you know if it's something like if this do this, you know that so that you can look at it and you know what that is doing."
P7,00:13:26,T2,Third,Offline,"But if it's get at first look at IF and . So those cool - you know don't feel like yeah, IF this value does this then that's probably could happen."
P6,00:13:39,T2,Third,Offline,You can give you a briefing on the top of that function like a bit.
P9,00:13:44,T2,Third,Offline,In documentation in terms of like how to expand what we're doing.
P8,00:13:49,T2,Third,Offline,I don't know if within the scope.
P9,00:13:52,T2,Third,Offline,"Oh, yeah, No because I was thinking you know how I know I supposed to finish this project. Should we leave something in cases like the company was to continue the project. Should we be like like tell them that oh, if you want to continue do do it, like they do it how we have been doing?"
P6,00:14:08,T2,Third,Offline,"I mean a lot of how they want to progress will depend on what they want to achieve in our world you are open to it. As long we we do it in a way where we have a pattern, you know that easy to follow we were picked it up and just look at it and you know, obviously recognize a pattern."
P7,00:14:33,T2,Third,Offline,Any programmer can pick off understand it and continue do with they want to do with it.
P6,00:14:37,T2,Third,Offline,If it's model model model view controller if it's one of you passing clinical architecture as long as it's you know well-known pattern that people can establish a bunch of software engineering things have you can we reproduce.
P7,00:14:59,T2,Third,Offline,Things are structured we have here. Understandable.
P6,00:15:03,T2,Third,Offline,"Yeah. Yeah,."
P7,00:15:04,T2,Third,Offline,So that's kind of a general good summation of what we planted in future. We already know things went well things didn't go so well in this iteration again. I'd say maybe unbalanced work. I finished a week before the presentation with all my all my same tasks for the Piecone stuff. There was only one Piecone  tasks left to do and worker said he was learning as a unit test for a fainted right but he would know where to write unit tests more that I would so that's absolutely fine. But it seemed there was a lot of jobs out of the Piecone on they thinking finished take you extra week. So I feel like maybe going for the future I mentioned this before at the start but maybe look at should help a bit more since seems like a lot of the Android task.
P6,00:16:04,T2,Third,Offline,I think there is still a lot more to learn a lot more to things like the rest API understanding how they can communicate with the different network server.
P8,00:16:16,T2,Third,Offline,"Yeah, exactly."
P6,00:16:18,T2,Third,Offline,"The.. so at moment, we can scan and filter devices now we gonna connect you know and print update data, so that's that's a lot of reading to do around there. Then there's the interface UI interface because what we are just now just to shell we needed it to look more polished."
P8,00:16:56,T2,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P7,00:16:57,T2,Third,Offline,"Yeah, I could probably hit that up if you guys wanted me to"
P8,00:17:04,T2,Third,Offline,I'll take any help. It will make us all look good
P6,00:17:31,T2,Third,Offline,"The new just direction that UI Development is going the app Google have this Android developer there that they do act. They tell developers about new ways of doing things or along how they're thinking, you know"
P7,00:17:50,T2,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P6,00:17:51,T2,Third,Offline,Future wise so I would suggest we will try and watch this videos so that we are developing something that be compatible towards the way. Android engineer I'M thinking
P8,00:18:09,T2,Third,Offline,"And that's what I was thinking lately the you I will be like, you know like me gets up like when you say Android Engineers are thinking you mean like how Android engineer or designer UI?"
P6,00:18:28,T2,Third,Offline,"An example would be they're trying I watched a video where they showed how they are trying to limit the amount of things, say for example. So those activities which are UI basically."
P8,00:18:54,T2,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P6,00:18:55,T2,Third,Offline,They avoid doing anything data-related inside.
P8,00:19:04,T2,Third,Offline,"The main, so  main will be just displaying."
P6,00:19:07,T2,Third,Offline,"Either jsut display if you want this data, get the data. to call and get the data."
P8,00:19:12,T2,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P6,00:19:12,T2,Third,Offline,"And then we should look how I look with probably things like the format of images, you know, do we want some kind of animations in all things. We will see how we're going to do some animations if it's scanning for something, you know, like a progress bar something spinning listening if you pull on the screen to refresh"
P8,00:19:48,T2,Third,Offline,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
P6,00:19:49,T2,Third,Offline,Make it make it look fine polish. It feels you know.
P7,00:19:55,T2,Third,Offline,It looks very nice.
P6,00:19:56,T2,Third,Offline,Yeah
P7,00:19:57,T2,Third,Offline,Obviously we should focus on functionality above that. Also prepare for can make things. Look quite nice.
P6,00:20:06,T2,Third,Offline,That's why I'm not that's why I personally am not pushing those things at moment you know.
P8,00:20:12,T2,Third,Offline,Once the whole thing is.
P6,00:20:13,T2,Third,Offline,First was the only thing wrong with you.
P9,00:20:16,T2,Third,Offline,"Yeah, I think for now be right up right before we get that until we can until we can connect to the device to device and we can see what kind of data I think we can just leave it like that and it once every month we can see what we need."
P6,00:20:31,T2,Third,Offline,"We can do refactor end and then do the UI, you know."
P7,00:20:35,T2,Third,Offline,Somewhere down the line.
P9,00:20:38,T2,Third,Offline,"Yeah, I don't think like that. So, let's see if we got everything if we'd done everything the function of this Vector specification requires us to do and then they I think let's say four of us. Everyone's doing UI. I I think we like even way quicker."
P6,00:20:55,T2,Third,Offline,Absolutely.
P7,00:20:55,T2,Third,Offline,"Yeah, if we just have everyone doing UI we could call the General design. Everyone could do a small part of that building but it is making sure."
P6,00:21:04,T2,Third,Offline,And and if we factor the code before doing that which means the UI the activities of the UI doesn't when we make changes to it is not going to affect the core larger they have because they are like separate classes to keep you.
P7,00:21:22,T2,Third,Offline,Yeah.
P6,00:21:25,T2,Third,Offline,Thank you very much for coming.
