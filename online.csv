P63,13:10:00,T14,First,Online,"PROJECT - Agile CIC: Sports and Physical Activity
"
P67,13:10:00,T14,First,Online,"1. Objectives can be defined as an app that people would want to use to track their physical activity, with a uniform and high-quality level of questioning involved, and easy to understand output for the end user"
P63,13:10:10,T14,First,Online,"On top of that, I think they'd like to aggregate the data so they can find out the best way to get different types of individuals to become more physically active. If they're trying to design the app for ""future planning"" then it might be a good idea for them to put more resources towards activities that people would be more likely to use (as a consequence of the factors lilsted - competence, confidence, etc.)"
P67,13:10:10,T14,First,Online,Failure could even be defined with the app working perfectly but not being intuitive enough for everyday use.
P63,13:10:00,T14,First,Online,"I agree. In addition, I think to achieve a successful outcome we should present the gathered data in a meaningful way so that interpretations can be made accurately and efficiently."
P67,13:10:00,T14,First,Online,Which ties into point 3. Previous attempts haven't been great at giving clear and useful feedback to users.
P66,13:10:00,T14,First,Online,"In terms of obstacles, designing the data gathering aspect is probably the biggest one - if you think about the range of sports and physical activity that people do, risk of injury is higher in some fields compared to others, individuals' goals vary dramatically too. It'd be a pretty useless app if the first step isn't done well."
P67,13:10:00,T14,First,Online,"Exactly. Some people are just going to want to focus on getting their fitness level up, others are going to be a little more enthusastic about sports. You've got such a wide level of experiences available and you'll need a large dataset to make it work.
"
P63,13:10:00,T14,First,Online,"Well, if I was thinking ahead about trying to gather the data, you gradually split it into different categories (sport/activity, then purpose), and this would then generate the correct set of questions to gather relevant data. Instead of asking a bunch of questions that bare no impact on the activity in question. So I think that before designing any sort of questionnaries, you could figure out a way of splitting the question set into different categories. Hopefully a more appropriate questionnaire tailored to the user would increase the number of respondents.
"
P67,13:10:00,T14,First,Online,"Various questions have various tags, and choices that users enter will select the tags to be used?
"
P63,13:10:00,T14,First,Online,"Yeah, could use django filtering to do that sort of thing.
"
P67,13:10:00,T14,First,Online,"Should we post a comment for each of the listed questions, then reply to each comment to keep it grouped together?"
P63,13:10:00,T14,First,Online,"Seems a useful way of running this,
"
P63,13:10:00,T14,First,Online,"Or we could list each project and discuss them there, that might make more sense."
P67,13:10:00,T14,First,Online,Good call.
P63,13:30:00,T8,First,Online,1. Success is managing to get the project to where we and the customer want it to be and to get it to a phase where everyone is satisfied
P35,13:30:00,T8,First,Online,5. The most important decisions are who is going to be doing what and what products we are going to be using
P35,13:30:00,T8,First,Online,Are we meant to be discussing this in relation to the proposed projects?
P37,13:35:00,T8,First,Online,I think so
P35,13:35:00,T8,First,Online,"I would say we avoid projects which require languages none of us have covered in great detail, such as the C++ requirement for the Medipix project"
P37,13:35:00,T8,First,Online,"Yeah, I definitely agree"
P35,13:35:00,T8,First,Online,The For Your Eyes Only project appears to be a complex project as it would require OCR and 3D tracking.
P37,13:35:00,T8,First,Online,There is a machine learning project
P35,13:35:00,T8,First,Online,The craft project one
P35,13:35:00,T8,First,Online,That could be interesting
P37,13:35:00,T8,First,Online,"If we were to look into the craft game project, what would it mean by game? Something where the AI learns to play against human players?"
P37,13:35:00,T8,First,Online,"Also, if the two viewers here are in control of this chat, our other members cannot join as the site claims the chat is full. Any advice on how to fix this?"
P37,13:35:00,T8,First,Online,I suggest we all read this pdf by wednesday to have a rough idea of what we want to do and what we dont
P35,12:55:00,T11,First,Online,hello?
P49,12:55:00,T11,First,Online,Hi!
P52,12:55:00,T11,First,Online,ah excellent
P49,12:56:00,T11,First,Online,so have you guys looked at the projects yet?
P49,12:55:00,T11,First,Online,I have had a look at a few
P52,12:57:00,T11,First,Online,the one that sticks out to me is the neural network arcade game
P49,12:57:00,T11,First,Online,that one sounds interesting 
P52,13:08:00,T11,First,Online,"the chat isnt working for another team member, so we are just combining our answers. so for question 1, id define the objective is to design a game that would introduce people into the concept of using neural networks and satellites"
P52,13:13:00,T11,First,Online,for the neural network arcade game proposal
P52,13:13:00,T11,First,Online,yeah and success would be having a working game.
P49,13:15:00,T11,First,Online,as for implications Id say that since this is a test before proper deployment within satelites the implications arent too severe
P49,13:16:00,T11,First,Online,Yea I agree with that 
P52,13:17:00,T11,First,Online,Id say that the project is important as it allows the potential customers to have an insights into the techonolgies used and leading potential customers to become actual customers 
P52,13:19:00,T11,First,Online,"yeah thats very true, and I think that answers the stakeholders and owner/sponsor question aswell"
P49,13:26:00,T11,First,Online,"to whoever is monitoring this, the others have been having connection issues to the chatroom and cant get back in"
P54,10:19:00,T12,First,Online,HI
P57,10:19:00,T12,First,Online,hi
P56,11:00:00,T12,First,Online,oi
P55,11:04:00,T12,First,Online,there we go
P54,11:04:00,T12,First,Online,noice
P56,11:04:00,T12,First,Online,hello
P56,11:04:00,T12,First,Online,Potential pickings: page 18 for the app project
P56,11:04:00,T12,First,Online,Seems ez
P54,11:05:00,T12,First,Online,We are thinking of going for a project which is fairly easy to implement so we can focus on making sure we do the whole process well
P55,11:06:00,T12,First,Online,thats fair
P55,11:06:00,T12,First,Online,"gimme a sec to read it tho, the text is tiny lmao"
P55,11:08:00,T12,First,Online,that seems reasonable
P55,11:08:00,T12,First,Online,how many of the projects have you checked out?
P54,11:09:00,T12,First,Online,im just reading through them now
P54,11:09:00,T12,First,Online,1 seems difficult
P54,11:09:00,T12,First,Online,2 seems like its writen by someone who doesn't really know how it will all work so might be difficult to work with
P55,11:10:00,T12,First,Online,agree about 2
P55,11:10:00,T12,First,Online,i assume since most of these are apps we're gonna be using java?
P54,11:11:00,T12,First,Online,Some of them say what language to use
P55,11:16:00,T12,First,Online,fair enough
P55,11:16:00,T12,First,Online,3 seems cool but seems kinda hard
P55,11:17:00,T12,First,Online,5 seems good cause we'll get good feedback from the trustee
P55,11:17:00,T12,First,Online,that'll make our lives a lot easier
P54,11:17:00,T12,First,Online,"moved on a bit now, page 14 is asking for iOS and Android so im against that"
P55,11:18:00,T12,First,Online,you need an apple sdk which costs £100 lmao
P55,11:19:00,T12,First,Online,so i agree
P54,11:19:00,T12,First,Online,haha no chance
P54,11:19:00,T12,First,Online,Page 17 seems really interesting
P54,11:19:00,T12,First,Online,and as its written by a very sciency person they should be pretty straight forward asking for requirements
P54,11:20:00,T12,First,Online,We are thinking of making a short list of 3 projects incase we dont get our first choice
P55,11:20:00,T12,First,Online,sounds good
P55,11:20:00,T12,First,Online,17 does sound really interesting btw
P54,11:21:00,T12,First,Online,yeah 17 and 18 are top 2 rn
P55,11:22:00,T12,First,Online,what you guys think about the second project for number 3?
P56,11:22:00,T12,First,Online,which page?
P55,11:23:00,T12,First,Online,4
P54,11:23:00,T12,First,Online,That was the one I meant was interesting but looked quite difficult I think
P54,11:23:00,T12,First,Online,mixed them up
P55,11:23:00,T12,First,Online,fairs fairs
P54,11:23:00,T12,First,Online,And the words neural network is scary
P55,11:23:00,T12,First,Online,i think the first project of the two is definitely more difficult
P54,11:23:00,T12,First,Online,of the shortlisted ones?
P55,11:23:00,T12,First,Online,yea that's the one which i agree with looks pretty hard lol
P55,11:23:00,T12,First,Online,"there are two, the one on page 4 seems interesting and not too difficult imho"
P55,11:25:00,T12,First,Online,the satellite simulation one
P55,11:26:00,T12,First,Online,what do you guys think
P54,12:26:00,T12,First,Online,seems pretty difficult with using Blender and that
P54,11:34:00,T12,First,Online,what do you think of the very last one
P55,11:34:00,T12,First,Online,fair enough
P54,11:34:00,T12,First,Online,seems like a pretty easy concept
P54,11:34:00,T12,First,Online,just have to make it on mobile
P55,11:34:00,T12,First,Online,seems reasonable but by cross-platform they might mean ios too
P54,11:34:00,T12,First,Online,yeah true
P54,11:34:00,T12,First,Online,dont have to pick today thank god
P54,11:35:00,T12,First,Online,can go over it more after today
P54,11:35:00,T12,First,Online,We should discuss the questions below now
P54,11:35:00,T12,First,Online,lets pick page 18 to talk about
P55,11:35:00,T12,First,Online,fairs
P55,11:35:00,T12,First,Online,also we can develop ios apps without paying but won't be able to publish them i think
P56,11:35:00,T12,First,Online,The objectives of project pg.18 is clearly defined we can use that as our milets
P56,11:35:00,T12,First,Online,stones
P55,11:36:00,T12,First,Online,"yup, success would be defined in doing at least the first three"
P56,11:36:00,T12,First,Online,We're just going to pick a couple questions since we'll leave soon
P56,11:37:00,T12,First,Online,Let's discuss 6)
P54,11:37:00,T12,First,Online,Learning to develop an app would be an obstacle
P55,11:37:00,T12,First,Online,was about to say
P55,11:40:00,T12,First,Online,maybe creating two different experiences for the centre and users?
P56,11:40:00,T12,First,Online,I personally think
P56,11:40:00,T12,First,Online,"POTENTIAL PROBLEMS Last year's student app development project was a success for us, but not without some hiccups from which lessons have been drawn. (1) We must agree full IP assignment to the Trust. (2) The app, and all data generated from it, must be hosted securely on the Trust's own servers. (Last year's turnstile app lost function and data records for several months when a third party server licence went unrenewed and contact could not be made with the developers). (3) The Trust should be given complete source code for future maintenance/ adaptation/ development/ replication. (4) The App should be operational in full compliance with GDPR regulations."
P54,11:45:00,T12,First,Online,I concur
P55,11:45:00,T12,First,Online,damn
P55,11:45:00,T12,First,Online,gdpr and security are big ones
P54,11:47:00,T12,First,Online,yeah true
P54,11:47:00,T12,First,Online,So what keeps us up at night about this?
P54,11:47:00,T12,First,Online,GDPR defo keeps me up at night
P56,11:48:00,T12,First,Online,Whether or not we'll get the project
P54,11:48:00,T12,First,Online, :S- 
P55,11:48:00,T12,First,Online,turning over the source code won't be too difficult
P55,11:49:00,T12,First,Online,"we'd need access to the servers ofc, not sure how to go about that"
P55,11:49:00,T12,First,Online,as said above
P54,11:49:00,T12,First,Online,I'm passionate about young people aged 13-30 gaining the confidence and skills they require to fulfil their potential in life
P55,11:50:00,T12,First,Online,deffo concur sean
P56,11:50:00,T12,First,Online, (y) 
P55,11:50:00,T12,First,Online,what are our personal passions about this project
P55,11:51:00,T12,First,Online,damn i didn't even see your message sean lmao
P55,11:51:00,T12,First,Online, :S- 
P54,11:52:00,T12,First,Online,"OK I want to go to lunch, anything else you want to say?"
P55,11:52:00,T12,First,Online,i guess we're done?
P55,11:53:00,T12,First,Online,lmao fairs
P54,11:53:00,T12,First,Online, (y) 
P56,11:53:00,T12,First,Online,Think we done
P55,11:54:00,T12,First,Online,so the football one is our third choice?
P54,11:54:00,T12,First,Online,Think so
P54,11:54:00,T12,First,Online,seems easy
P55,11:54:00,T12,First,Online,sounds good
P56,11:54:00,T12,First,Online,NICE
P55,11:54:00,T12,First,Online,sweet
P55,11:54:00,T12,First,Online,see you guys next week i suppose lmao
P54,11:54:00,T12,First,Online,yep see you then
P56,11:55:00,T12,First,Online, :D 
P44,13:01:37,T10,First,Online,what are we supposed to talk about then?
P45,13:01:47,T10,First,Online,How do we define success 
P44,13:02:55,T10,First,Online,haha
P44,13:05:49,T10,First,Online,"ok, this is a bit generic"
P44,13:05:57,T10,First,Online,but lets give it a go
P44,13:05:59,T10,First,Online,success is when there is nothing else to do
P44,13:06:05,T10,First,Online,so it is never really attainable but you can get close to it
P46,13:07:36,T10,First,Online,Well to me success of the project start with successfully being assigned to a team where the team members seem to care and work hard (enough) :D
P45,13:07:41,T10,First,Online,Getting a good grade would be nice as well
P46,13:07:43,T10,First,Online,"Yeah but without too much stressful, i.e. we meet the deadlines in the meantime etc."
P46,13:07:45,T10,First,Online,*stress
P45,13:07:50,T10,First,Online,If the project doesn't succeed I think the implications are clear
P46,13:07:51,T10,First,Online,What do you mean?
P45,13:07:55,T10,First,Online,That we're either not very motivated or smart 
P45,13:08:30,T10,First,Online,Whichever you choose 
P46,13:08:35,T10,First,Online,I don't think these projects require you to be smart tbh
P45,13:08:38,T10,First,Online,Then motivated 
P46,13:08:47,T10,First,Online,I guess this is gonna be a dialogue then
P45,13:08:49,T10,First,Online,A dialogue is better than a monologue 
P45,13:08:52,T10,First,Online,What do you think are the key milestones?
P47,13:09:01,T10,First,Online,"I don't quite understand what they mean by , why is this problem so important.."
P47,13:09:07,T10,First,Online,*project
P47,13:09:18,T10,First,Online,We don't even know our topic
P47,13:09:40,T10,First,Online,Key milestones? To have a prototype before Christmas
P47,13:09:46,T10,First,Online,And then presenting the product to the client maybe
P45,13:09:53,T10,First,Online,Let's just pick one from the list 
P47,13:10:01,T10,First,Online,What are important milestones for you?
P47,13:10:03,T10,First,Online,Hi
P45,13:10:11,T10,First,Online,Same as you said 
P45,13:10:12,T10,First,Online,You like the charity project?
P47,13:10:28,T10,First,Online,IDK there is a couple
P47,13:10:31,T10,First,Online,The image processing one sounds fine
P45,13:10:46,T10,First,Online,Let's focus on it then
P47,13:10:56,T10,First,Online,What are the most important decisions to be made?
P45,13:11:04,T10,First,Online,How to implement it in the most efficient way and what role will each of us have in the first place
P47,13:11:39,T10,First,Online,Yeah and I think only bad communication can prevent us from making bad decisions
P45,13:11:44,T10,First,Online,Prevent?
P47,13:12:04,T10,First,Online,Bad decisions are a great learning experience
P47,13:12:18,T10,First,Online,Lol that was a typo
P45,13:17:21,T10,First,Online,That's why we should probably focus on communication between ourselves 
P45,13:20:55,T10,First,Online,And the customer 
P47,13:21:47,T10,First,Online,Yeah my mum told me that usually the hardest part
P47,13:22:03,T10,First,Online,Since the customer often does not know how programming works
P47,13:22:52,T10,First,Online,Or has idea that won't work in practice
P47,13:22:55,T10,First,Online,And it's our task to give them last popsci explanation of why something is not realisable
P47,13:22:59,T10,First,Online,*the
P45,13:23:13,T10,First,Online,The problem is that we might not know either 
P47,13:23:15,T10,First,Online,Well I think we kind of do
P47,13:23:20,T10,First,Online,The details we can research
P45,13:23:45,T10,First,Online,Hopefully we do
P45,13:24:09,T10,First,Online,What risks are we willing to take?
P47,13:24:47,T10,First,Online,But often people have ideas
P47,13:24:58,T10,First,Online,But can make them precise
P47,13:25:07,T10,First,Online,Can't*
P47,13:25:22,T10,First,Online,As riskfree as possible?
P47,13:25:25,T10,First,Online,Try to get done everything as soon as possible?
P47,13:25:43,T10,First,Online,Always be super nice and accommodating to the customer
P45,13:25:47,T10,First,Online,I think they're asking what risks we're willing to take to make the project successful 
P45,13:26:11,T10,First,Online,All the risks
P47,13:27:08,T10,First,Online,Why does it need to be risks
P47,13:27:38,T10,First,Online,We just go safe lol
P47,13:27:38,T10,First,Online,The question is not precise imo
P45,13:27:38,T10,First,Online,Yeah true
P45,13:27:45,T10,First,Online,What keeps me up at night about this is that I need a good grade
P47,13:27:55,T10,First,Online,We should always fcusf on keeping the customer up to date
P47,13:28:09,T10,First,Online,Running after them to make sure they know what's up
P47,13:28:10,T10,First,Online,And involving them in the most important changes
P47,13:28:40,T10,First,Online,Yeah and we all have to work hard
P45,13:28:56,T10,First,Online,You're right
P47,13:29:06,T10,First,Online,Otherwise everyone is screwed
P45,13:29:12,T10,First,Online,So my personal passion about this is making something actually working 
P45,13:29:15,T10,First,Online,What topics haven't we discussed?
P47,13:29:18,T10,First,Online,I want sth interesting otherwise it will feel like a chore every Wednesday
P45,13:29:33,T10,First,Online,We'll pick something interesting 
P47,13:29:50,T10,First,Online,And get an A1
P45,13:30:22,T10,First,Online,I'm fine with an A5
P47,13:30:35,T10,First,Online,Reach for the Stars
P45,13:30:41,T10,First,Online,I'm the only one here now
P45,13:31:05,T10,First,Online,Yay
P42,13:31:08,T9,First,Online,ur mom keeps me up at night😍
P42,13:31:14,T9,First,Online,I am this projects greatest assets
P41,13:31:18,T9,First,Online,"Most of these questions are hard to answer at this stage of the project since we don't have a project yet. 
"
P43,13:31:29,T9,First,Online,"I think the key milestones are gathering initial requirements, design/planning, implementation, QA, and upkeep. Repeat the steps, for further development."
P42,13:31:40,T9,First,Online,yes those sound good 👍
P42,13:31:40,T9,First,Online,proud of u
P42,13:31:44,T9,First,Online,I'd rather not discuss ur mom
P42,13:32:02,T9,First,Online,got em
P42,13:32:32,T9,First,Online,I like trains
P43,13:32:43,T9,First,Online,controversial opinion
P39,13:32:58,T9,First,Online,"The Objective, is not to fail the project in order to progress to 4th year.
Success is defined as the opposite of failure :dabBlob:"
P41,13:33:07,T9,First,Online,Success = Happy and satisfied customer.
P43,13:34:08,T9,First,Online,this is the minimum of happiness we need to achieve -> 😺
P43,13:34:32,T9,First,Online,If the project doesn't succeed 😟😡
P41,13:34:40,T9,First,Online,"I agree, that would be very😟
"
P39,13:34:43,T9,First,Online,"I share your views man, here is a video that helps narrow the chances of failing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
P43,13:34:57,T9,First,Online,"I will never give up on this project 👍👍👍
"
P59,13:01:00,T13,First,Online,Anyone make it into the chat?
P59,13:01:00,T13,First,Online, :o.O 
P60,13:02:00,T13,First,Online,:|
P58,13:05:00,T13,First,Online,OLE
P62,13:05:00,T13,First,Online,Ohhh
P60,13:05:00,T13,First,Online,Hhh?
P62,13:06:00,T13,First,Online,Now it works apparently
P58,13:07:00,T13,First,Online,wow
P58,13:07:00,T13,First,Online,if I put my name as
P58,13:07:00,T13,First,Online,HHHH
P58,13:07:00,T13,First,Online,it works
P58,13:07:00,T13,First,Online,HAHA
P60,13:07:00,T13,First,Online,Interesting stuff
P60,13:07:00,T13,First,Online,Hhh?
P58,13:08:00,T13,First,Online,You know what the problem might be
P58,13:08:00,T13,First,Online,I checked the PLAN
P58,13:08:00,T13,First,Online,this chatroom is on
P58,13:08:00,T13,First,Online,it allows only 4 seats
P62,13:08:00,T13,First,Online,And?
P62,13:08:00,T13,First,Online,Haha :D 
P60,13:09:00,T13,First,Online,Well
P60,13:09:00,T13,First,Online,I can make room for someone else :)
P58,13:09:00,T13,First,Online,so probably one more can join in
P62,13:09:00,T13,First,Online,And are we supposed to just discuss the projects over here?
P58,13:09:00,T13,First,Online,yeah
P58,13:09:00,T13,First,Online,pretty much what we did last time
P58,13:10:00,T13,First,Online,but you guys didnt make it
P62,13:10:00,T13,First,Online,But this is just chat only yeah?
P62,13:10:00,T13,First,Online,I know :( 
P58,13:10:00,T13,First,Online,so this should be new
P58,13:10:00,T13,First,Online,have a look at the projects
P58,13:10:00,T13,First,Online,skim them through
P58,13:10:00,T13,First,Online,pick out like 4 that both of you find interesting at first glance
P58,13:10:00,T13,First,Online,doesnt have to be the ones we already saw
P62,13:11:00,T13,First,Online,Right
P58,13:11:00,T13,First,Online,lets give ourselves like
P58,13:11:00,T13,First,Online,7 mins
P60,13:12:00,T13,First,Online,Sure man
P58,13:12:00,T13,First,Online,"also, refer to the questions on the left, they were quite helpful last time in shortlisting projects"
P58,13:17:00,T13,First,Online,alright guys 3 more mins and then lets list the projects we found the best
P58,13:20:00,T13,First,Online,all done?
P60,13:21:00,T13,First,Online,I was thinking there's a plus with the first one
P60,13:22:00,T13,First,Online,"Them doing development already would make it a lot easier to communicate, right?"
P58,13:22:00,T13,First,Online,"Yeah but it would also limit our choices of langauges, frameworks etc"
P58,13:22:00,T13,First,Online,its not 
P58,13:22:00,T13,First,Online,a bad project
P62,13:23:00,T13,First,Online,That's true
P60,13:23:00,T13,First,Online,Good point
P58,13:23:00,T13,First,Online,"seems pretty good, getting people active"
P60,13:23:00,T13,First,Online,"For the second one, I thought it'd be too much to involve neural nets already"
P58,13:24:00,T13,First,Online,"from the info i guess what they want is just a questionnaire app, that stores and analysis user data"
P62,13:24:00,T13,First,Online,Do you mean for the first project Jawad?
P60,13:24:00,T13,First,Online,"Sorry, let's stick with the first one :)"
P58,13:25:00,T13,First,Online,"yeah we discussed the nueral network project, seemed like it would require a HUGE amount of effort on our part"
P62,13:25:00,T13,First,Online,"Yeah, most likely"
P58,13:25:00,T13,First,Online,"yeah, wasnt Ole talking about the first one"
P58,13:25:00,T13,First,Online,"Jan, which one did you like the most"
P60,13:25:00,T13,First,Online,I changed too soon
P62,13:26:00,T13,First,Online,"To me, I really liked the first project at the first glance"
P62,13:27:00,T13,First,Online,"But then when I read it again, it seems to be more hci oriented and would mostly revolve around designing an aesthetically pleasing interface and data visualisation "
P62,13:27:00,T13,First,Online,So not that challenge and definitely not a challenge I am looking for
P60,13:27:00,T13,First,Online,Yep :/
P58,13:27:00,T13,First,Online,haha running away from HCI
P62,13:27:00,T13,First,Online,So true haha :D 
P60,13:27:00,T13,First,Online,OBASHI tho?
P62,13:28:00,T13,First,Online,Let me have a look
P60,13:28:00,T13,First,Online,Might also be too HCI
P58,13:28:00,T13,First,Online,Obashi was actually my first choice
P58,13:28:00,T13,First,Online,it involves some encryption learning 
P58,13:29:00,T13,First,Online,and is kind of challenging without being overwhelming
P62,13:29:00,T13,First,Online,Yes
P58,13:29:00,T13,First,Online,it was one of the shortlisted ones
P62,13:29:00,T13,First,Online,I like that project a lot
P62,13:29:00,T13,First,Online,"yeah, we discussed it a bit in the lab on wednesday"
P62,13:29:00,T13,First,Online,Also I like the idea of it
P62,13:30:00,T13,First,Online,It would require some form of pic to text conversion and then the actual process of decrypting the data
P58,13:30:00,T13,First,Online,exactly
P58,13:30:00,T13,First,Online,would allow us to work with different challenges
P62,13:30:00,T13,First,Online,And the whole idea that your phone is going to be the key to decrypting it is quite appealing :) 
P58,13:31:00,T13,First,Online,"but keep in mind, Matus isnt tooo fond of it"
P62,13:31:00,T13,First,Online,"Yes, and I can imagine, it still would be perfectly doable "
P62,13:31:00,T13,First,Online,Oh really?
P58,13:31:00,T13,First,Online,Ivelina is okay with it
P62,13:31:00,T13,First,Online,Hmm
P58,13:31:00,T13,First,Online,also
P62,13:31:00,T13,First,Online,And how about you Jawad and the Sports project?
P58,13:31:00,T13,First,Online,check out the sportslab
P58,13:32:00,T13,First,Online,"yeah Im okay with it, the only problem I had with the project is"
P58,13:32:00,T13,First,Online,"seems simple, idk I cant see where the crazy challenge might be, but I could be wrong"
P58,13:32:00,T13,First,Online,Ole? what do you think as well
P60,13:32:00,T13,First,Online,I did like the sports one :)
P60,13:33:00,T13,First,Online,Seems very managable
P62,13:34:00,T13,First,Online,it's true that the greatest challenge would be to do the math correctly and produce an accurate result
P58,13:34:00,T13,First,Online,"so its like pros and cons, sports is simpler probably easier and involved with quite a reputable client"
P60,13:34:00,T13,First,Online,"Maths is easy, no worries!"
P58,13:34:00,T13,First,Online,"plus its sports, we're all into it"
P62,13:34:00,T13,First,Online,"I think that between the sportslab and obashi, obashi is going to be more challenging "
P60,13:35:00,T13,First,Online,Agreed
P58,13:35:00,T13,First,Online,yeah
P58,13:35:00,T13,First,Online,for me its still pretty much
P58,13:35:00,T13,First,Online,Obashi > SportsLab
P62,13:35:00,T13,First,Online,"I know math is easy, it will just be interesting to put all the features together "
P58,13:35:00,T13,First,Online, :D 
P60,13:35:00,T13,First,Online,:D
P62,13:35:00,T13,First,Online,I see :D 
P58,13:36:00,T13,First,Online,"but both of them are great, wouldnt mind doing either of them"
P58,13:36:00,T13,First,Online,need to talk to the clients
P60,13:36:00,T13,First,Online,I feel the same way on that
P62,13:36:00,T13,First,Online,true :) 
P58,13:36:00,T13,First,Online,its like
P58,13:36:00,T13,First,Online,theres a larger risk with obashi
P62,13:36:00,T13,First,Online,And how about the other ones you shortlisted?
P58,13:36:00,T13,First,Online,but a larger reward
P62,13:36:00,T13,First,Online,"high risk, high reward ;)"
P58,13:36:00,T13,First,Online,and the opposite with sports lab
P60,13:37:00,T13,First,Online,"Hm, is the reward indirect?"
P60,13:37:00,T13,First,Online,Do we benefit in concrete ways?
P58,13:37:00,T13,First,Online,reward is pretty much the satisfaction
P58,13:37:00,T13,First,Online,of doing it
P58,13:37:00,T13,First,Online, :D 
P60,13:37:00,T13,First,Online,I'd be careful then :D
P62,13:37:00,T13,First,Online,Well said my friend :D 
P62,13:38:00,T13,First,Online,It would be a greater achievement to successfully complete a more complex project :) 
P58,13:38:00,T13,First,Online,although
P58,13:38:00,T13,First,Online,we wont be judged
P58,13:38:00,T13,First,Online,on the COMPLEXITY
P58,13:38:00,T13,First,Online,of our projects
P58,13:38:00,T13,First,Online,just how good we do them
P58,13:38:00,T13,First,Online,sooooooooo
P58,13:38:00,T13,First,Online,theres that
P58,13:38:00,T13,First,Online, :D :D :D :D
P62,13:39:00,T13,First,Online,"Yeah, but to me my personal satisfaction is an important factor :D  "
P60,13:39:00,T13,First,Online,I like good grades ;)
P60,13:39:00,T13,First,Online,"But yeah, there's that :)"
P62,13:39:00,T13,First,Online,So I would rather stay away from all the hci bs :D 
P58,13:39:00,T13,First,Online,well to be fair
P58,13:39:00,T13,First,Online,obashi would invovle
P58,13:39:00,T13,First,Online,quite a bit of HCI
P58,13:39:00,T13,First,Online,so would sports
P62,13:39:00,T13,First,Online,I doubt that the five of us won't be able to handle a greater challenge ;) 
P60,13:40:00,T13,First,Online,Of course :D
P62,13:40:00,T13,First,Online,"Well all of the projects would to a certain extent, but these two are not built on it :) "
P58,13:40:00,T13,First,Online,yes lets leave all the projects
P58,13:40:00,T13,First,Online,program a spacecraft
P58,13:40:00,T13,First,Online,whos with me
P58,13:40:00,T13,First,Online, ;) 
P62,13:40:00,T13,First,Online,+
P62,13:41:00,T13,First,Online,haha :D 
P58,13:41:00,T13,First,Online,alright so I guess
P58,13:41:00,T13,First,Online,what we take from today is
P58,13:41:00,T13,First,Online,Ole : Sports > Obashi
P60,13:41:00,T13,First,Online,Yee
P58,13:41:00,T13,First,Online,Jan : Obashi > Sports
P62,13:41:00,T13,First,Online,right 
P58,13:41:00,T13,First,Online,Jawad : Obashi > Sports
P58,13:41:00,T13,First,Online,we know that for Matus
P58,13:42:00,T13,First,Online,Sports > Obashi
P62,13:42:00,T13,First,Online,So it's 2v2 now :D
P58,13:42:00,T13,First,Online,and Invelina is pretty much Sports == Obashi
P62,13:42:00,T13,First,Online,Ivelina has to decide haha :D 
P62,13:42:00,T13,First,Online,Ohhhhh :D 
P58,13:42:00,T13,First,Online,yep
P60,13:42:00,T13,First,Online,Damnit Inveline :D
P62,13:42:00,T13,First,Online,So we got nowhere :D 
P58,13:42:00,T13,First,Online,no
P58,13:42:00,T13,First,Online,see
P62,13:42:00,T13,First,Online,Decide nooooooooow :D 
P58,13:42:00,T13,First,Online,what we gave done is
P60,13:42:00,T13,First,Online,Flip coin?
P60,13:42:00,T13,First,Online,Rock paper scissors? :D
P58,13:42:00,T13,First,Online,put it on Ivelina
P60,13:42:00,T13,First,Online,Aah
P62,13:43:00,T13,First,Online,Or don't do any of them and find sth else :D 
P62,13:43:00,T13,First,Online,Alright guys
P60,13:43:00,T13,First,Online,So we all agree?
P62,13:43:00,T13,First,Online,Shall we finish it here? :) 
P60,13:43:00,T13,First,Online,Invelina takes one for the team? :D
P58,13:43:00,T13,First,Online,"yeah, for now"
P58,13:43:00,T13,First,Online,Obashi and Sports
P58,13:43:00,T13,First,Online,are top
P58,13:43:00,T13,First,Online,we can discusss others in detail later
P62,13:43:00,T13,First,Online,And let the final decision to be made when we meet in person? 
P58,13:43:00,T13,First,Online,and if it comes down to it
P62,13:44:00,T13,First,Online,yh
P58,13:44:00,T13,First,Online,we will be evil and make Ivelina choose
P60,13:44:00,T13,First,Online,Cool :D
P62,13:44:00,T13,First,Online,Haha :D 
P62,13:44:00,T13,First,Online,The pressure is on :D 
P60,13:44:00,T13,First,Online,(Y)
P60,13:44:00,T13,First,Online,:(
P58,13:44:00,T13,First,Online,thats great work
P58,13:44:00,T13,First,Online,time to say goodbye
P60,13:44:00,T13,First,Online,Yee
P60,13:44:00,T13,First,Online,Sayonara
P62,13:44:00,T13,First,Online,right
P62,13:45:00,T13,First,Online,ty guys and cya around 
P58,13:45:00,T13,First,Online, :-Z 
P62,13:45:00,T13,First,Online, <-^ 
P63,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"What about writing all the testing stuff? I understood the material covered in OOSE2 well enough, but I'm not very good at the actual implementation."
P63,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"6. Have we changed the structure of the team yet? If so, how and why?"
P63,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"Except from reassigning Hassan's roles, there's been no need to change the structure. Are either of you unhappy with your roles?"
P66,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"I'm happy with our assigned roles too. I think we work well as a team. How about you Bekah?
"
P67,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"I'm happy as librarian and customer liason. We should probably just check in every month or so that everyone is happy with their roles though, and maybe shift things around if people want to try something else.
"
P66,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"I agree, we should have mostly discussions but so far I think things are going well. "
P63,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,👍
P63,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,5. Are we finding our coaches useful?
P63,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"Sort of, it's nice having two. I guess it's too early to have found any really use for them yet. they gave some good information regarding live wireframe interaction today, and some feedback on what software to use.
"
P67,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,I definitely feel like having 2 coaches is helpful as we get two different opinions and two extra sets of eyes which may notice things we've missed. I don't think we'll really hit the point where we're able to say if they've been invaluable until we start properly working on the project.
P66,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"I think our coaches have been really helpful so far. I agree, we haven't had detailed discussions regarding our work with them but we're still early in the design stage so I think that's understandable."
P66,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"I think having two coaches is great too. I think they have been generous with their knowledge and I found their recommended resources useful.
"
P63,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,4. How are we finding the behaviour of our customers?
P63,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,Sonia and Ron are fine. They need to communicate better though - see Q2 above.
P67,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"Agreed. They're nice but they need to communicate better with each other and with us. We may also need to hold their hands through some of the more technical details to get clearer responses and feedback.
"
P66,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,I agree and they seem willing to dedicate time for discussing the project when necessary which is great.
P63,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"Do you think they're happy to leave us to develop this at our own pace since they don't know much (anything) about software development, provided they're kept in the loop? 

I think that's a positive aspect of being assigned this project - other customers that were at the customer day would probably be more demanding since they have an idea in their head of how much should be getting done by certain dates.
"
P66,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"Yes, they seem to trust us as long as we keep them updated regularly I think we can work at our own pace."
P63,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"3. Have we decided to use a new technology (to us)? If so, is it concerning?"
P63,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"Whatever we use will be new for me. I've never even looked at developing mobile apps. Do either of you have any experience?
"
P67,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"No experience with designing mobile apps but I look forward to seeing where this goes.
"
P63,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"Have you had a look at any of the potential options we've discussed so far? 

- Android Studio 
- React Native
- Unity (apparently this is possible).

"
P66,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"We could brainstorm ideas on the discord chat - I think 'Pain Killers' came up but we have lots of time to come up with something 
"
P67,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"I feel like our best bet for the design suite is to go for something in a language we know with a lot of user support available if need be.
"
P66,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"I think we need to do more research but React Native will be in JavaScript and Android Studio will probably be in Java (Kotlin is also an option but is a new language for everyone). We need to weigh the pros and cons for all our options.
. "
P63,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"Is anyone particularly good at design? I'm not very keen on it (doing those wireframes ate up my entire weekend), so I'd lean towards Android Studio since it's more user friendly.

We're probably better taking some more time to work with them individually before discussing it; that should probably be done by next Wednesday before we meet our coaches.
"
P66,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,I'm the chief architect so I can help you with the design.
P63,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,2. Do we have to work across teams?
P63,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"No, we don't. Bekah - it turns out there was miscommunication between Sonia and Ron, so both groups are doing the application separately.

Maybe we should use this space to discuss some possible team names?"
P66,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"Maybe we can have a poll on discord for the team names?
"
P63,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"Good plan, we can each come up with a name and then do a poll like we done for Call vs Skype.
"
P67,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"I was there when we were informed that there had been miscommunication. I guess this is a great and noble tradition of miscommunications. I have no real idea what we'd call ourselves as a team tbh,
"
P66,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"I think as we will be following the Agile methodology and using issue tracking, we'll be okay working on the different stages.
"
P63,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,1. Are we concerned about the scope of the project?
P63,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"Yes, I've never dealt with a project of this scope. How do you guys feel about it?
"
P66,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"Yes, I believe there will be steep learning curve, but our requirements gathering helped to reduce my initial concern.
"
P63,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"Do you think you have a good idea of where we should be at different stages of the project? By that I mean, do you have an idea of what we should have completed for the app by certain dates.
"
P67,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"The project is bigger than any computing project I've done before, but I do look forward to seeing where we can go. We've already made a good start on looking at functionality
"
P63,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"I worked on a web app over the summer that was pretty challenging, but it didn't have nearly as much planning as this. Maybe it's trying to plan out so much from the start that's making it difficult for me to see how to approach the whole thing.

Guess that's the point in this course: to learn these things.
"
P67,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"I personally find the planning really helpful. When it comes to implementation, I'm a little more worried but we've got a good idea of what we need to build and we've already started drafting out how we want to do this all.
"
P66,12:11:56,T14,Second,Online,"I agree, I feel our planning is very helpful. I think being able to contact our clients easily minimises my concern as well. We can get feedback and constantly assess our work. 
"
P38,12:11:10,T8,Second,Online,"1. After our last meeting with the client we built up a significant list of features for the application which were building. There were some features we were slightly concerned on how to integrate based on the time we have for development. That being said, we had agreed with the client that those features can be pushed aside and made as extra features or a wish list of features if the final product is built with enough time to spare. We then worked from top to bottom on the application flow to iron out and get concrete requirements so we know what features we need to implement.
 2. We do not work across teams.
 3. We have all agreed that two new technologies (to us) will be used, these being React and NodeJS. These technologies are very heavily used in the industry and have various resources for documentation, libraries etc. so we arent worried about using them. 
 4. The customer  is very co-operative and open to different ideas for the application. They are happy to meet us on a consistent schedule to ensure that what were building meets their vision and requirements.
 5. Our coach has provided us starter help with how to deal with clients and what we should be asking - drawing on their own experience to provide with some perspective.
 6. The team currently has a loose structure, with no concrete roles currently assigned. We are assisting each other for meantime as we are just starting our project but as we get more into development we will each be more focused on our own roles (while still providing support to team members). We intend on changing about the roles as we continue through the year so each member gets a chance to experience different roles within a functioning team."
P35,12:11:03,T8,Second,Online,"5. Coaches are extremely useful because they can provide guidance not only on the project, but on other matters important for us as well"
P37,12:11:12,T8,Second,Online,"1. The scope of the project is wide in terms of the possible analysis option for the data, but through discussions with the client, this scope of reduced significantly to the point I feel comfortable we will complete the project.
2. We do not work across teams.
3. We have decided to use two new technologies since the client plans to expand the project after our submission, and the new technologies are used in their preexisting products. The use of the new technologies is not concerning as they are widely used in the industry, and as such have extensive documentation and tutorials, meaning the barrier of entry is reduced. Also, the technologies have been designed to be simple to understand and produce a basic product with, while having the option of extensive customization and extension as required.
4. Our customers are extremely cooperative and open to discussion about the product.
5. Our coach provides meta-level support for how to approach the project and best handle VCS and CI. This has helped when starting discussions with the client and working collaboratively on the development of the product.
6. Out team structure has changed from having rigidly defined structure to a loosely defined structure, where each member understands who is each role, while aiding each member as required."
P49,12:11:00,T11,Second,Online,"1. not especially, the the requirements are very broad so we should be able to adapt if the scope ends up being too big

2. nope

3. yes weve started using openCV and have spent the last few weeks learning and researching it, so it hasnt been too concerning yet

4. the customers seem great, theyve been very helpful in supplying resources and guidance.

5. yes, its very handy especially since Kerrys project last year was very similar to the one we currently have

6. nope"
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"Q6) Have we changed the structure of the team yet? If so, how and why?"
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"Still in requirements gathering, have not established much structure to the teams yet. The roles weve decided upon will come into effect once requirements are gathered. 
"
P57,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"Yeah I reckon its a little too early to figure this out, we could revisit this a one further on in the project."
P53,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"Yeah I think well figure out what peoples strengths are once we start coding
"
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,Q5) How are our coache(s)?
P57,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,I like ewan and think hes been a good resource in pointing us in the right direction with how to go about doing our user stories etc and keeping us on track
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"Its nice to have someone whos been through the project before, guiding us through pitfalls and showing us what to do. His critique of user story/persona like Luke said is very helpful since he knew what Darryl wanted out of it.
"
P53,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"Yeah ewan is sick, been really helpful. From what Ive heard hes way better than coaches other teams have
"
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,Q4) How are we finding the behaviour of our customers?
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,hahaha
P57,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,4) So how are we finding the customers behaviour
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"Darryl was hard to get a hold of first, it seemed to be a busy period for him, we have him booked now for this week and the next week. I think hes much more responsive once we have him on call
"
P53,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"seems basically like my stereotype of an office boss tbh, he gets shit done but he isnt that pleasant to talk to. Also seems very opinionated, like how he wants us to use angular and refused to use discord
"
P53,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"But yeah he is committed to the project which is good
"
P57,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"Yeah I was a bit worried when it took him a while to join the slack etc but everything seems fine now. I do agree with you rory on that, and him being a little unsure about what he wants from the project (client or web application) is a little frustrating"
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"I find Angular to be a bit concerning, the syntax and the amount of new stuff we have to learn is intimidating
"
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"how do i remove this
"
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,yo guys our comments from the top are being deleted
P53,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"lmao ah well
"
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,Q3) Are we using new tech? Is it concerning to us?
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"I find Angular to be a bit concerning, the syntax and the amount of new stuff we have to learn is intimidating"
P57,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"If were going for a web app then I assume we could use django/some other tech from wad, but I think the new stuff is a little intimidating "
P53,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,yeah Ive not really dug into it yet but the guy seems to like it and it is pretty popular so must be alright  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"I would like to become more familiarized with Electron/Angular that were doing so if anyone has tutorials etc.. I would appreciate the links 
"
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"Moving on, question 2) Do we have to work across teams?"
P53,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"no lol, unless we want to nick ideas from the other team
"
P57,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"Yeah I cant imagine that happening
"
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"agreed
"
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"ok decided to do it on here instead, scope of the project noted, will be discussed with Darryl tomorrow

"
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,rory m8 lets just go on slack for live discussion then post our answers to questions here
P53,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"Yo if you just go into the html you can just drag the comment box div below the comments

"
P53,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"But its nested VERY deep lol
"
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"1) - What do we think about the scope? I find the Windows App into WebApps concering, he doesnt seem to have a clear idea which he wants, I feel its best for us to push for the Web Application"
P57,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"I agree, we need to confirm what were going to be building as soon as we can. I think the web app is the better option."
P53,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"Yeah I think hes not clear on what he wants, so the scope of the project isnt well defined. Not sure if were deploying just to his company or we need a universal product, etc

"
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"This is some bad UI, Im gonna have to scroll down n up everytime
"
P53,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,hello
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"We can wait for boys

"
P57,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"yeah I meant when they join

"
P57,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,should we just go question by question?
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"What happened to the live chat? lol
"
P66,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,"test
"
P57,12:11:00,T12,Second,Online,😃
P44,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,the most important thing for me is coordination and support i find these thing in my coaches. The knowledge in specific field is very important and the coach we have are very supporting and informative.
P46,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online, 
P46,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,"we can use machine learning techniques on the data of costumers 
 "
P45,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,"data analytics and potentially prediction models can greatly help the businesses
"
P46,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,its difficult to deploy but once it is deployed everything can be easy ❤
P44,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,I have discussed this project with retailer market owners and they seemed happy as time factor is reduced and they seemed willing to have this system. if we deploy the system in retailer market then customer must be satisfied as checkout time will be reduced as customers valuable time will not be wasted.
P45,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,"the market place will also benefit as they will be able to bring in more customers as the average time one consumer spends in the store will be reduced.

"
P45,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,"have you discussed benefit for retailers with owners ?

"
P45,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,the novelty of the idea alone will bring in more consumers who want to test out the system.
P44,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,"Ali :
yes i have discussed it. they seemed willing
"
P45,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,"thats great news.

"
P46,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,"IOT can be of very helpful

"
P45,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,yes but for you need a central hub 😃
P45,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,that*
P44,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,RFID is new technology we have to work with it as how to link it with web and mobile application. Server management must be a problem we will face as cloud server must deployed to coordinated web and mobile application.
P45,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,"Instead of cloud server we should deploy  local server for the fyp as we dont have that much time to deploy cloud server

"
P45,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,"We can make a local server for prototyping

"
P45,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,we should also start working data analysis  @arslan
P46,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,data analytics can help business to grow efficiently 
P46,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,"we dont need to work across the teams , we have to work insuring the  designers developers and all must be at the same place"
P44,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,i dont think so that work should be done across teams as we are located in same location.
P45,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,we might have to do it if we want expand and incubate our project
P46,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,"yes considering the nature of project all the members should be at the same place

"
P46,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,👍
P45,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,I am also concerned about the deployment cost
P44,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,Equipment are costly but we have to manage it in accordance with faculty.
P45,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,"@hassan khan you are right 

"
P46,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,yes 👍
P46,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,"The problems faced by the customer in a store,we are concerned  about facilitating the customer such that a business could grow more.

"
P44,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,we are concerned about scope of project as we are focusing on problems facing in retailer market. 
P45,13:11:33,T10,Second,Online,"yes we are  concerned about the scope of the project, because how much difficulties retailers market faces due to lack of technology integration.

"
P60,10:30:15,T13,Third,Online,1. The scope of the project seems pretty manageable. No concern.
P60,10:30:44,T13,Third,Online,2. We should cooperate with the other team which also got this client.
P60,10:30:46,T13,Third,Online,"3. We are going to have to learn new technologies in accordance with our planning, but we are not concerned."
P60,10:31:35,T13,Third,Online,"4. Communicating clearly with the customer can be a challenge, but we are approaching it optimistically."
P60,10:32:23,T13,Third,Online,"5. The coachs previous experience, and guidance is proving helpful."
P60,10:32:30,T13,Third,Online,6. The structure of the team has not changed since we decided on roles.
P57,10:33:10,T12,Third,Online,"I think the progress of the project has been halted quite significantly due to the issues with the system over christmas, but having moved the project to a private gitlab, I think well be able to progress and meet our goals for the next iteration"
P57,10:33:29,T12,Third,Online,"Possibly not all of them due to the time constraints, but I reckon we can achieve the more important ones (getting a pdf uploaded, squares drawn, and text extracted) in time"
P44,10:12:07,T10,Third,Online, ok I am working on SRS document
P44,10:12:09,T10,Third,Online,Yes. Tayyab do you know about EEG technology?
P44,10:12:11,T10,Third,Online,Yes waleed discuss in detail so tayyab will also get it
P45,10:12:12,T10,Third,Online,"Hey, what is the idea of our our FYP project"
P45,10:12:16,T10,Third,Online,"Hey Everyone, I hope you all are good"
Sul,10:12:19,T10,Third,Online,Hi waleed. how are you and what you think about the FYP idea which we discussed in my home last night?
P45,10:12:20,T10,Third,Online,We have to discuss some more things on idea.
P45,10:12:21,T10,Third,Online,"Our last idea was to detect lie using BCI technology, any update on that ?"
P45,10:12:22,T10,Third,Online,We should work on the project that helps disables
P44,10:12:22,T10,Third,Online,waleed discuss in detail so tayyab will also get it
P45,10:12:22,T10,Third,Online,Disables ? What technology will we use ? Image processing? 
P45,10:12:22,T10,Third,Online,"We can use EEG Signals to get Brain Signals and disable person can play game by only using their mind.
"
P44,10:12:28,T10,Third,Online,Yes. Tayyab do you know about EEG technology?
P45,10:12:29,T10,Third,Online,"I heard about it, I think some companies working on it, I heard about EMOTIV and thier devices."
P45,10:12:30,T10,Third,Online,"We may use Emotiv Insight device which is cheap in that technology to record brain activities

"
P44,10:12:22,T10,Third,Online,Yes Emotiv is the device which is used to record EEG signals. Basically EEG technology are which captures brain activity in signal form
P45,10:12:34,T10,Third,Online,"Alright, But Waleed why EMOTIV INSIGHT, there are more powerful devices available like EMOTIV EPOC+ which can give us better accuracy.
Search Here : 
"
P45,10:12:34,T10,Third,Online,Emotiv Insight is very user friendly and easy to wear and its accuracy is also good as its price
P44,10:12:34,T10,Third,Online,yes tayyab Emotiv insight is also cheaper then EPOC+ and our project will done with this device easily.
P45,10:12:34,T10,Third,Online,"Alright, If thats enough for our project then lets do it.
What game engine we will be using to make game ?
I suggest UnReal Engine, It is based on new technology.
"
P45,10:12:34,T10,Third,Online,"I know UNITY it use c#, what language UnReal Engine support ?"
P45,10:12:34,T10,Third,Online,"In which language, we will implement our project?"
P44,10:12:34,T10,Third,Online,UnReal Engine supports C++ and it is also used by many famous games and I do work on Unreal Engine. It is easy to develop game with basic functionality
P45,10:12:34,T10,Third,Online,"We will use python for project, Python is very powerful when it come to machine learning or processing algorithms."
P45,10:12:34,T10,Third,Online,"Ok Lets discuss the scope our our project
"
P44,10:12:34,T10,Third,Online,Tayyab I think you will get it what we are trying to make. This is a game which is fully dedicated to persons which have some type of disability and they does not enjoy the E-gaming. In this way they will also take part in the events and socialize with other people. In this way they have not regret of being disable. They feel confident. 
P45,10:12:34,T10,Third,Online,"There is no major activities for disables. So, I think this is a big opportunity for them to stay their focus clear and that also helps in our project"
P45,10:12:34,T10,Third,Online,"We have to present this idea to panel on coming Monday,
So finalized idea is we are going to make a game for disables using EMOTIV INSIGHT device, which use EEG Signals to get brain data.
"
P44,10:12:34,T10,Third,Online,ok first we should prepare our defense presentation
P45,10:12:34,T10,Third,Online,"Yeah, I see the schedule of Defense Presentations on Slate "
P45,10:12:40,T10,Third,Online,We would also have to do some search on process of our project
P45,10:12:40,T10,Third,Online,"Okay, I study about EEG technology, Waleed you search about EMOTIV and Suleman get the information about UnReal engine, then we compile them to one document."
P44,10:12:40,T10,Third,Online,yes I make my part slides which is on game idea and how we are going to develop it
P45,10:12:40,T10,Third,Online,"Okay, We will search for it"
P45,10:12:40,T10,Third,Online,"So presentation is ready ? Suleman can you share the updated slides on google drive, so I can take a look."
P44,10:12:40,T10,Third,Online,yes I email you. check your email
P45,10:12:40,T10,Third,Online,Tomorrow is our Presentation at 2:45 after Jummah Break
P45,10:12:40,T10,Third,Online,"Thanks, for reminder Waleed.
See you both tomorrow.
"
P44,10:12:40,T10,Third,Online,Ok brothers. With the blessing of Allah our idea is accepted. Now we should research on further details on how we are going to implement this idea like how we are taking brain signal from device etc
P45,10:12:40,T10,Third,Online,"Tomorrow we have to go to our Supervisor.
"
P45,10:12:40,T10,Third,Online,What time Waleed ?

P45,10:12:41,T10,Third,Online,"Alright, Ill be working on domain model and class Diagram."
P45,10:12:41,T10,Third,Online,"Ive pushed Domain Model and Class diagram on github, you both push your updates too, so we can cross check all the documents."
P45,10:12:41,T10,Third,Online,Please create a pull request on Github
P44,10:12:41,T10,Third,Online,I pushed it and working on SSD
P45,10:12:41,T10,Third,Online,"Waleed! Check again, its done."
P44,10:12:41,T10,Third,Online,"I pushed SSD and working on SD 

"
P45,10:12:41,T10,Third,Online,I pushed my work and I am working on System Sequence Diagram
P45,10:12:45,T10,Third,Online,"Okay, I am working on Activity diagram.
Waleed when is our next meeting with supervisor ?
"
P45,10:12:45,T10,Third,Online,I made an appointment with our supervisor at 2:00 clock
P44,10:12:45,T10,Third,Online,Ok I will be there
P45,10:12:45,T10,Third,Online,"Push all the work on GitHub, we have one day left."
P44,10:12:45,T10,Third,Online,I pushed all the work from my side. I will stay in hostel for preparation of our Mid Pesentation
P45,10:12:45,T10,Third,Online,I made all of the changes and update my branch on GitHub. You can take a pull of my branch
P45,10:12:45,T10,Third,Online,"Okay, we do all proof reading one more time before the presentation,
Good Luck for presentation 
"
P44,10:12:45,T10,Third,Online,"Ok Brothers. Masha Allah. The door of success are opening by Almighty Allah. Alhamdulillah  . Now I think our implementation part is remaining, documentation clears maximum doubts.  "
P45,10:12:45,T10,Third,Online,"Waleed you issue the device from University tomorrow, while Ill study about EMOTIV Cortex Apis and Suleman you download and install all cortex packages we need."
P45,10:12:45,T10,Third,Online,I issued the device and also install Cortex desktop App on my Laptop
P44,10:12:48,T10,Third,Online,I setup cortex with python
P45,10:12:48,T10,Third,Online,"Lets record the signals and apply Classification algorithms, I think we should try SVM first."
P45,10:12:49,T10,Third,Online,I think we should apply some feature extraction on our data
P44,10:12:53,T10,Third,Online,Yes PCA is good and well known algorithm for feature extraction
P45,10:12:58,T10,Third,Online,"Okay, then first we will apply PCA on our data-set then go for Classification algorithms."
P39,10:29:00,T9,Third,Online,hello team mates
P40,10:29:00,T9,Third,Online,Hey !!
P39,10:30:00,T9,Third,Online,fawad are you there
P41,10:30:00,T9,Third,Online,Yes i am on it
P39,10:30:00,T9,Third,Online,lets discuss the project
P40,10:30:00,T9,Third,Online,what do you guys think about the scope of project ?
P39,10:31:00,T9,Third,Online,mate bassically the scope of this project is very high 
P40,10:32:00,T9,Third,Online,how  come ?
P39,10:32:00,T9,Third,Online,we are basically building an e game which is emotionaly intelligent 
P39,10:33:00,T9,Third,Online,this game detect your emotions through your face and change the sceniero according to your emotion
P40,10:33:00,T9,Third,Online,ok it seems quite interesting ?
P39,10:33:00,T9,Third,Online,yeah its quite interesting 
P39,10:33:00,T9,Third,Online,as you can see :)
P40,10:34:00,T9,Third,Online,Have you started the implementation ?
P39,10:34:00,T9,Third,Online,We are currently doing the module of emotion detection 
P41,10:35:00,T9,Third,Online,Yes firstly i am working  on the  Facial emotion recognize module 
P40,10:35:00,T9,Third,Online,ok then ?
P41,10:36:00,T9,Third,Online,In the first step i detect face 
P41,10:36:00,T9,Third,Online,and also extract features 
P41,10:38:00,T9,Third,Online,"But awais, I am having some problem while downloading the data set from keggle"
P39,10:39:00,T9,Third,Online,yeah i know about this 
P39,10:39:00,T9,Third,Online,i read some faqs related about kagle dataset 
P39,10:40:00,T9,Third,Online,the moderator of discussion says that 
P39,10:40:00,T9,Third,Online,the data set can be used as a web service
P39,10:40:00,T9,Third,Online,they have provided the api 
P39,10:40:00,T9,Third,Online,which can be accessible thorugh python CLI
P41,10:42:00,T9,Third,Online,"so awais you do work on the api ,and implement it"
P41,10:42:00,T9,Third,Online,currently i am using jaffe data set 
P41,10:43:00,T9,Third,Online,Jaffe data set have 300 emotional images
P40,10:44:00,T9,Third,Online,"i think we will doing much effort to complete this daring game,,"
P39,10:45:00,T9,Third,Online,yes its a bit difficult task but we will try our best to complete this module
P39,10:46:00,T9,Third,Online,if we work together this is not going to be difficult 
P40,10:47:00,T9,Third,Online,have u guys any idea how will we be doing the psychological section of the game?
P41,10:48:00,T9,Third,Online,But the mates good thing is we complete the three steps 1.detect face 2.crop face 3. feature extract
P39,10:48:00,T9,Third,Online,thats great 
P39,10:50:00,T9,Third,Online,asad we are currently focusing on emotion detection module
P39,10:50:00,T9,Third,Online,we will do pyschological module in next term 
P40,10:51:00,T9,Third,Online,lets come to facial detection ..
P40,10:52:00,T9,Third,Online,which method are you using for facial detection.
P41,10:54:00,T9,Third,Online,I used Haar cascade algorithm for face detection
P40,10:54:00,T9,Third,Online,"hmm, tell me about its working ?"
P41,10:56:00,T9,Third,Online,I am using Open CV (computer vision library)
P40,10:57:00,T9,Third,Online,working of Haar cascade
P40,10:57:00,T9,Third,Online,tell me about it ..
P41,10:57:00,T9,Third,Online,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267990783_Implementation_of_Face_Detection_System_Using_Haar_Classifiers
P41,10:58:00,T9,Third,Online,Asad read this and you will know implementation of face detection using haar classifier
P40,10:59:00,T9,Third,Online,tell me about the overview and i'll definately read it..
P41,11:01:00,T9,Third,Online,"A Haar Cascade is basically a classifier which is used to detect the object for which it has been trained for, from the source. The Haar Cascade is by superimposing the positive image over a set of negative images. The training is generally done on a server and on various stages."
P40,11:02:00,T9,Third,Online,ok got it
P41,11:02:00,T9,Third,Online,Awais are you there??
P39,11:05:00,T9,Third,Online,yeah 
P39,11:05:00,T9,Third,Online,i am reading your messages
P40,11:06:00,T9,Third,Online,What's your contribution till now awais ?
P40,11:06:00,T9,Third,Online,what are you woking on
P40,11:07:00,T9,Third,Online,explain it please!
P39,11:09:00,T9,Third,Online,asad i am currently doing work on dataset 
P39,11:09:00,T9,Third,Online,we are facing some complexities in downloading dataset 
P40,11:10:00,T9,Third,Online,tell me about the training process ?
P41,11:10:00,T9,Third,Online,Tell us.. can you find a way how to save all features in a file with label ??
P41,11:14:00,T9,Third,Online,awais??
P39,11:16:00,T9,Third,Online,yess 
P39,11:16:00,T9,Third,Online,i consulted hashir they are also doing the same module
P39,11:18:00,T9,Third,Online,they asked me to store the features in the variable 
P39,11:18:00,T9,Third,Online,and then use that variable where you needed
P41,11:19:00,T9,Third,Online,ok mates
P39,11:20:00,T9,Third,Online,okay 
P63,16:11:01,T14,Third,Online,No we havent changed the structure yet. Im not sure if we plan to do that even!
P64,16:11:04,T14,Third,Online,I am not sure if were even allowed to do that 
P65,16:11:07,T14,Third,Online,I think we are fine the way we are
P66,16:11:10,T14,Third,Online,That will take place once we implement the project. If its not confirmable for the end user than we will change the structure according to there criteria.
P63,16:11:14,T14,Third,Online,Coaches are very useful actually!
P65,16:11:18,T14,Third,Online,giving us real help
P64,16:11:21,T14,Third,Online,"yes,Indeed.Theyve been really helpful all along so far."
P66,16:11:20,T14,Third,Online,No doubt if coach is motivated than yes
P65,16:11:20,T14,Third,Online,"Its still in the making phases, we dont hae customers"
P64,18:11:20,T14,Third,Online,* have 
P63,16:11:37,T14,Third,Online,But we plan to target the metropolitan.
P64,16:11:46,T14,Third,Online,but we plan on targeting the metropoliton government
P64,16:11:52,T14,Third,Online,lol jinx
P66,16:11:52,T14,Third,Online,I disagree metropolitan is not our only customer. Dustin will be in fact also used by people using dustbins. Yes even though these people wont buy these dustbins only waste management companies will buy them. But they will pay for these services to the metropolitan govt. and they will benefit from it also. 
P63,16:11:52,T14,Third,Online,I think we will be using the already defined concepts. IOT  is the major area
P64,16:11:52,T14,Third,Online,"well to us,It is kind of new."
P65,16:11:52,T14,Third,Online,We are actually new to this.. I agree
P66,16:11:52,T14,Third,Online,We are definitely using IOT which is the future of the technologies we use today this field will improve day by day
P64,16:11:52,T14,Third,Online,For 2. Yes if needed
P63,16:11:52,T14,Third,Online,"We will be having two teams I think, hardware and software teams! 2 people each. What do u say?"
P64,16:11:52,T14,Third,Online,Sounds good
P65,16:11:52,T14,Third,Online,Yes 
P66,16:11:52,T14,Third,Online,"The project we select is on the waste management system. The major concern is the waste pollution caused in different areas in Pakistan. And the focus is making the waste collection a timely and efficient solutions.

"
P65,16:11:52,T14,Third,Online,"Yes,One of the most important thing to be concerned about "
P64,16:11:52,T14,Third,Online,"Yes definitely,Its very important."
P63,16:11:52,T14,Third,Online,"Yes, definitely. A projects scope is everything if we want it to be successful in the longer run. A waste management system is much needed in a country like Pakistan."
P66,16:11:52,T14,Third,Online,Yes but if you see the status quo of Pakistan awareness is also important and timely getting the waste is included. 
P65,16:11:52,T14,Third,Online,"1. Yes
2. Yes
3. Not yet
4. Satisfying
5. At times, Yes
6. No"
P66,16:11:52,T14,Third,Online,"1. No
